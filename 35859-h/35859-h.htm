<p class="pfirst">“And now,” said Major Doyle, rubbing his
hands together as he half reclined in his big chair
in a corner of the sitting room, “now we shall
enjoy a nice cosy winter in dear New York.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Cosy?” said his young daughter, Miss Patricia
Doyle, raising her head from her sewing
to cast a glance through the window at the whirling
snowflakes.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Ab-so-lute-ly cosy, Patsy, my dear,” responded
the major. “Here we are in our own
steam-heated flat—seven rooms and a bath, not
counting the closets—hot water any time you
turn the faucet; a telephone call brings the
butcher, the baker, the candlestick-maker; latest
editions of the papers chucked into the passage!
What more do you want?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Tcha!”</p>
<p class="pnext">This scornful ejaculation came from a little
bald-headed man seated in the opposite corner,
who had been calmly smoking his pipe and
dreamily eyeing the flickering gas-log in the
grate. The major gave a start and turned to
stare fixedly at the little man. Patsy, scenting
mischief, indulged in a little laugh as she threaded
her needle.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Sir! what am I to understand from that
brutal interruption?” demanded Major Doyle
sternly.</p>
<p class="pnext">“You’re talking nonsense,” was the reply, uttered
in a tone of cheery indifference. “New
York in winter is a nightmare. Blizzards, thaws,
hurricanes, ice, la grippe, shivers—grouches.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Drumsticks!” cried the major indignantly.
“It’s the finest climate in the world—bar none.
We’ve the finest restaurants, the best theatres,
the biggest stores and—and the stock exchange.
And then, there’s Broadway! What more can
mortal desire, John Merrick?”</p>
<p class="pnext">The little man laughed, but filled his pipe
without reply.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Uncle John is getting uneasy,” observed
Patsy. “I’ve noticed it for some time. This is
the first snowstorm that has caught him in New
York for several years.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“The blizzard came unusually early,” said Mr.
Merrick apologetically. “It took me by surprise.
But I imagine there will be a few days
more of decent weather before winter finally
sets in. By that time—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well, what then?” asked the major in defiant
accents, as his brother-in-law hesitated.</p>
<p class="pnext">“By that time we shall be out of it, of course,”
was the quiet reply.</p>
<p class="pnext">Patsy looked at her uncle reflectively, while
the major grunted and shifted uneasily in his
chair. Father and daughter were alike devoted
to John Merrick, whose generosity and kindliness
had rescued them from poverty and thrust
upon them all the comforts they now enjoyed.
Even this pretty flat building in Willing Square,
close to the fashionable New York residence district,
belonged in fee to Miss Doyle, it having
been a gift from her wealthy uncle. And Uncle
John made his home with them, quite content in
a seven-room-flat when his millions might have
purchased the handsomest establishment in the
metropolis. Down in Wall Street and throughout
the financial districts the name of the great
John Merrick was mentioned with awe; here in
Willing Square he smoked a pipe in his corner of
the modest sitting room and cheerfully argued
with his irascible brother-in-law, Major Doyle,
whose business it was to look after Mr. Merrick’s
investments and so allow the democratic little
millionaire the opportunity to come and go as
he pleased.</p>
<p class="pnext">The major’s greatest objection to Uncle John’s
frequent absences from New York—especially
during the winter months—was due to the fact
that his beloved Patsy, whom he worshiped with
a species of idolatry, usually accompanied her
uncle. It was quite natural for the major to resent
being left alone, and equally natural for
Patsy to enjoy these travel experiences, which in
Uncle John’s company were always delightful.</p>
<p class="pnext">Patsy Doyle was an unprepossessing little
thing, at first sight. She was short of stature and
a bit plump; freckled and red-haired; neat and
wholesome in appearance but lacking “style” in
either form or apparel. But to her friends Patricia
was beautiful. Her big blue eyes, mischievous
and laughing, won hearts without effort, and
the girl was so genuine—so natural and unaffected—that
she attracted old and young alike
and boasted a host of admiring friends.</p>
<p class="pnext">This girl was Uncle John’s favorite niece, but
not the only one. Beth De Graf, a year younger
than her cousin Patsy, was a ward of Mr. Merrick
and lived with the others in the little flat
at Willing Square. Beth was not an orphan, but
her father and mother, residents of an Ohio
town, had treated the girl so selfishly and inconsiderately
that she had passed a very unhappy
life until Uncle John took her under his wing
and removed Beth from her depressing environment.
This niece was as beautiful in form and
feature as Patsy Doyle was plain, but she did
not possess Patsy’s cheerful and uniform temperament
and was by nature reserved and diffident
in the presence of strangers.</p>
<p class="pnext">Yet Beth had many good qualities, among
them a heart-felt sympathy for young girls who
were not so fortunate as herself. On this disagreeable
winter’s day she had set out to visit
a settlement school where she had long since
proved herself the good angel of a score of
struggling girls. The blizzard had developed
since she left home, but no one worried about
her, for Beth was very resourceful.</p>
<p class="pnext">There was another niece, likewise dear to John
Merrick’s heart, who had been Louise Merrick
before she married a youth named Arthur Weldon,
some two years before this story begins.
A few months ago Arthur had taken his young
wife to California, where he had purchased a
fruit ranch, and there a baby was born to them
which they named “Jane Merrick Weldon”—a
rather big name for what was admitted to be a
very small person.</p>
<p class="pnext">This baby, now five months old and reported
to be thriving, had been from its birth of tremendous
interest to every inhabitant of the Willing
Square flat. It had been discussed morning,
noon and night by Uncle John and the girls,
while even the grizzled major was not ashamed
to admit that “that Weldon infant” was an important
addition to the family. Perhaps little
Jane acquired an added interest by being so far
away from all her relatives, as well as from the
fact that Louise wrote such glowing accounts of
the baby’s beauty and witcheries that to believe
a tithe of what she asserted was to establish the
child as an infantile marvel.</p>
<p class="pnext">Now, Patsy Doyle knew in her heart that
Uncle John was eager to see Louise’s baby, and
long ago she had confided to Beth her belief
that the winter would find Mr. Merrick at Arthur
Weldon’s California ranch, with all his three
nieces gathered around him and the infantile
marvel in his arms. The same suspicion had
crept into Major Doyle’s mind, and that is why
he so promptly resented the suggestion that New
York was not an ideal winter resort. Somehow,
the old major “felt in his bones” that his beloved
Patsy would be whisked away to California,
leaving her father to face the tedious
winter without her; for he believed his business
duties would not allow him to get away to accompany
her.</p>
<p class="pnext">Yet so far Uncle John, in planning for the
winter, had not mentioned California as even a
remote possibility. It was understood he would
go somewhere, but up to the moment when he
declared “we will be out of it, of course, when
the bad weather sets in,” he had kept his own
counsel and forborne to express a preference or
a decision.</p>
<p class="pnext">But now the major, being aroused, decided to
“have it out” with his elusive brother-in-law.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Where will ye go to find a better place?” he
demanded.</p>
<p class="pnext">“We’re going to Bermuda,” said Uncle John.</p>
<p class="pnext">“For onions?” asked the major sarcastically.</p>
<p class="pnext">“They have other things in Bermuda besides
onions. A delightful climate, I’m told, is one of
them.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The major sniffed. He was surprised, it is
true, and rather pleased, because Bermuda is so
much nearer New York than is California; but
it was his custom to object.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Patsy can’t go,” he declared, as if that settled the
question for good and all. “The sea
voyage would kill her. I’m told by truthful persons
that the voyage to Bermuda is the most terrible
experience known to mortals. Those who
don’t die on the way over positively refuse ever
to come back again, and so remain forever exiled
from their homes and families—until they have
the good luck to die from continually eating
onions.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Mr. Merrick smiled as he glanced at the
major’s severe countenance.</p>
<p class="pnext">“It can’t be as bad as that,” said he. “I know
a man who has taken his family to Bermuda for
five winters, in succession.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“And brought ’em back alive each time?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Certainly. Otherwise, you will admit he
couldn’t take them again.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“That family,” asserted the major seriously,
“must be made of cast-iron, with clockwork
stomachs.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Patsy gave one of her low, musical laughs.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I think I would like Bermuda,” she said.
“Anyhow, whatever pleases Uncle John will
please me, so long as we get away from New
York.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Why, ye female traitor!” cried the major;
and added, for Uncle John’s benefit: “New York
is admitted by men of discretion to be the modern
Garden of Eden. It’s the one desideratum of—”</p>
<p class="pnext">Here the door opened abruptly and Beth came
in. Her cheeks were glowing red from contact
with the wind and her dark tailor-suit glistened
with tiny drops left by the melted snow. In her
mittened hand she waved a letter.</p>
<p class="pnext">“From Louise, Patsy!” she exclaimed, tossing
it toward her cousin; “but don’t you dare read
it till I’ve changed my things.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Then she disappeared into an inner room and
Patsy, disregarding the injunction, caught up
the epistle and tore open the envelope.</p>
<p class="pnext">Uncle John refilled his pipe and looked at
Patsy’s tense face inquiringly. The major stiffened,
but could not wholly repress his curiosity.
After a moment he said:</p>
<p class="pnext">“All well, Patsy?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“How’s the baby?” asked Uncle John.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Dear me!” cried Patsy, with a distressed
face; “and no doctor nearer than five miles!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Both men leaped from their chairs.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Why don’t they keep a doctor in the house?”
roared the major.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Suppose we send Dr. Lawson, right away!”
suggested Uncle John.</p>
<p class="pnext">Patsy, still holding up the letter, turned her
eyes upon them reproachfully.</p>
<p class="pnext">“It’s all over,” she said with a sigh.</p>
<p class="pnext">The major dropped into a chair, limp and
inert. Uncle John paled.</p>
<p class="pnext">“The—the baby isn’t—dead!” he gasped.</p>
<p class="pnext">“No, indeed,” returned Patsy, again reading.
“But it had colic most dreadfully, and Louise
was in despair. But the nurse, a dark-skinned
Mexican creature, gave it a dose of some horrid
hot stuff—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Chile con carne, most likely!” ejaculated the
major.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Horrible!” cried Uncle John.</p>
<p class="pnext">“And that cured the colic but almost burned
poor little Jane’s insides out.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Insides out!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“However, Louise says the dear baby is now
quite well again,” continued the girl.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Perhaps so, when she wrote,” commented
the major, wiping his forehead with a handkerchief;
“but that’s a week ago, at least. A thousand
things might have happened to that child
since then. Why was Arthur Weldon such a
fool as to settle in a desert place, far away from
all civilization? He ought to be prosecuted for
cruelty.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“The baby’s all right,” said Patsy, soothingly.
“If anything serious happened, Louise would
telegraph.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I doubt it,” said the major, walking the floor.
“I doubt if there’s such a thing as a telegraph
in all that forsaken country.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Uncle John frowned.</p>
<p class="pnext">“You are getting imbecile, Major. They’ve
a lot more comforts and conveniences on that
ranch than we have here in New York.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Name ’em!” shouted the Major. “I challenge
ye to mention one thing we haven’t right
here in this flat.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Chickens!” said Beth, re-entering the room
in time to hear this challenge. “How’s the baby,
Patsy?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Growing like a weed, dear, and getting more
lovely and cunning every second. Here—read
the letter yourself.”</p>
<p class="pnext">While Beth devoured the news from California
Uncle John replied to the major.</p>
<p class="pnext">“At El Cajon Ranch,” said he, “there’s a
fine big house where the sunshine peeps in and
floods the rooms every day in the year. Hear
that blizzard howl outside, and think of the roses
blooming this instant on the trellis of Louise’s
window. Arthur has two automobiles and can
get to town in twenty minutes. They’ve a long-distance
telephone and I’ve talked with ’em over
the line several times.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You have!” This in a surprised chorus.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I have. Only last week I called Louise up.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“An expensive amusement, John,” said the
major grimly.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes; but I figured I could afford it. I own
some telephone stock, you know, so I may get
part of that investment back. They have their
own cows, and chickens—as Beth truly says—and
any morning they can pick oranges and
grapefruit from their own trees for breakfast.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’d like to see that precious baby,” remarked
Beth, laying the letter on her lap to glance pleadingly
at her uncle.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Uncle John is going to take us to Bermuda,”
said Patsy in a serious voice.</p>
<p class="pnext">The little man flushed and sat down abruptly.
The major, noting his attitude, became disturbed.</p>
<p class="pnext">“You’ve all made the California trip,” said
he. “It doesn’t pay to see any country twice.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But we haven’t seen Arthur’s ranch,” Beth
reminded him.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Nor the baby,” added Patsy, regarding the
back of Uncle John’s head somewhat wistfully.</p>
<p class="pnext">The silence that followed was broken only by
the major’s low growls. The poor man already
knew his fate.</p>
<p class="pnext">“That chile-con-carne nurse ought to be discharged,”
mumbled Uncle John, half audibly.
“Mexicans are stupid creatures to have around.
I think we ought to take with us an experienced
nurse, who is intelligent and up-to-date.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, I know the very one!” exclaimed Beth.
“Mildred Travers. She’s perfectly splendid.
I’ve watched her with that poor girl who was
hurt at the school, and she’s as gentle and skillful
as she is refined. Mildred would bring up
that baby to be as hearty and healthful as a
young savage.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“How soon could she go?” asked Uncle John.</p>
<p class="pnext">“At an hour’s notice, I’m sure. Trained
nurses are used to sudden calls, you know. I’ll
see her to-morrow—if it’s better weather.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Do,” said Uncle John. “I suppose you girls
can get ready by Saturday?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Of course!” cried Patsy and Beth in one
voice.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Then I’ll make the reservations. Major
Doyle, you will arrange your business to accompany
us.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I won’t!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You will, or I’ll discharge you. You’re
working for me, aren’t you?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I am, sir.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Then obey orders.”</p>
</div>
<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-iiel-cajon-ranch">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id3">CHAPTER II—EL CAJON RANCH</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">Uncle John always traveled comfortably and
even luxuriously, but without ostentation. Such
conveniences as were offered the general public
he indulged in, but no one would suspect him of
being a multi-millionaire who might have ordered
a special train of private cars had the inclination
seized him. A modest little man, who had made
an enormous fortune in the far Northwest—almost
before he realized it—John Merrick had
never allowed the possession of money to deprive
him of his simple tastes or to alter his kindly
nature. He loved to be of the people and to
mingle with his fellows on an equal footing, and
nothing distressed him more than to be recognized
by some one as the great New York financier.
It is true that he had practically retired
from business, but his huge fortune was invested
in so many channels that his name remained
prominent among men of affairs and this notoriety
he was unable wholly to escape.</p>
<p class="pnext">The trip to California was a delight because
none of his fellow passengers knew his identity.
During the three days’ jaunt from Chicago to
Los Angeles he was recognized only as an engaging
little man who was conducting a party of
three charming girls, as well as a sedate, soldierly
old gentleman, into the sunny Southland for a
winter’s recreation.</p>
<p class="pnext">Of these three girls we already know Patsy
Doyle and Beth DeGraf, but Mildred Travers
remains to be introduced. The trained nurse
whom Beth had secured was tall and slight, with
a sweet face, a gentle expression and eyes so
calm and deep that a stranger found it disconcerting
to gaze within them. Beth herself had
similar eyes—big and fathomless—yet they
were so expressive as to allure and bewitch the
beholder, while Mildred Travers’ eyes repelled
one as being masked—as concealing some well
guarded secret. Both the major and Uncle John
had felt this and it made the latter somewhat
uneasy when he reflected that he was taking this
girl to be the trusted nurse of Louise’s precious
baby. He questioned Beth closely concerning
Mildred and his niece declared that no kindlier,
more sympathetic or more skillful nurse was ever
granted a diploma. Of Mildred’s history she
was ignorant, except that the girl had confided
to her the story of her struggles to obtain recognition
and to get remunerative work after graduating
from the training school.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Once, you know,” explained Beth, “trained
nurses were in such demand that none were ever
idle; but the training schools have been turning
them out in such vast numbers that only those
with family influence are now sure of work.
Mildred is by instinct helpful and sympathetic—a
natural born nurse, Uncle John—but because
she was practically a stranger in New York she
was forced to do charity and hospital work, and
that is how I became acquainted with her.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“She seems to bear out your endorsement,
except for her eyes,” said Uncle John. “I—I
don’t like—her eyes. They’re hard. At times
they seem vengeful and cruel, like tigers’ eyes.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, you wrong Mildred, I’m sure!” exclaimed
Beth, and Uncle John reluctantly accepted
her verdict. On the journey Miss Travers
appeared well bred and cultured, conversing
easily and intelligently on a variety of subjects,
yet always exhibiting a reserve, as if she held
herself to be one apart from the others. Indeed,
the girl proved so agreeable a companion that
Mr. Merrick’s misgivings gradually subsided.
Even the major, still suspicious and doubtful, admitted
that Mildred was “quite a superior person.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Louise had been notified by telegraph of the
coming of her relatives, but they had withheld
from her the fact that they were bringing a
“proper” nurse to care for the Weldon baby.
The party rested a day in Los Angeles and then
journeyed on to Escondido, near which town the
Weldon ranch was located.</p>
<p class="pnext">Louise and Arthur were both at the station
with their big seven-passenger touring car. The
young mother was promptly smothered in embraces
by Patsy and Beth, but when she emerged
from this ordeal to be hugged and kissed by
Uncle John, that observing little gentleman
decided that she looked exactly as girlish and
lovely as on her wedding day.</p>
<p class="pnext">This eldest niece was, in fact, only twenty
years of age—quite too young to be a wife and
mother. She was of that feminine type which
matures slowly and seems to bear the mark of
perpetual youth. Mrs. Weldon’s slight, willowy
form was still almost childlike in its lines, and
the sunny, happy smile upon her face seemed
that of a school-maid.</p>
<p class="pnext">That tall, boyish figure beside her, now heartily
welcoming the guests, would scarcely be recognized
as belonging to a husband and father.
These two were more like children playing at
“keeping house” than sedate married people.
Mildred Travers observed the couple with evident
surprise; but the others, familiar with the
love story of Arthur and Louise, were merely
glad to find them unchanged and enjoying their
former health and good spirits.</p>
<p class="pnext">“The baby!”</p>
<p class="pnext">That was naturally the first inquiry, voiced
in concert by the late arrivals; and Louise, blushing
prettily and with a delightful air of proprietorship,
laughingly assured them that “Toodlums”
was very well.</p>
<p class="pnext">“This is such a glorious country,” she added
as the big car started off with its load, to be
followed by a wagon with the baggage, “that
every living thing flourishes here like the green
bay trees—and baby is no exception. Oh, you’ll
love our quaint old home, Uncle John! And,
Patsy, we’ve got such a flock of white chickens!
And there’s a new baby calf, Beth! And the
major shall sleep in the Haunted Room, and—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Haunted?” asked the major, his eyes twinkling.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’m sure they’re rats,” said the little wife,
“but the Mexicans claim it’s the old miser himself.
And the oranges are just in their prime
and the roses are simply magnificent!”</p>
<p class="pnext">So she rambled on, enthusiastic over her ranch
home one moment and the next asking eager
questions about New York and her old friends
there. Louise had a mother, who was just now
living in Paris, much to Arthur Weldon’s satisfaction.
Even Louise did not miss the worldly-minded,
self-centered mother with whom she had
so little in common, and perhaps Uncle John and
his nieces would never have ventured on this
visit had Mrs. Merrick been at the ranch.</p>
<p class="pnext">The California country roads are all “boulevards,”
although they are nothing more than
native earth, rolled smooth and saturated with
heavy oil until they resemble asphalt. The automobile
was a fast one and it swept through the
beautiful country, all fresh and green in spite of
the fact that it was December, and fragrant with
the scent of roses and carnations, which bloomed
on every side, until a twenty-minute run brought
them to an avenue of gigantic palms which led
from the road up to the ranch house of El Cajon.</p>
<p class="pnext">Originally El Cajon had been a Spanish grant
of several thousand acres, and three generations
of Spanish dons had resided there. The last of
these Cristovals had erected the present mansion—a
splendid, rambling dwelling built around an
open court where a fountain splashed and tall
palms shot their swaying crowns far above the
housetop. The South Wing was the old dwelling which
the builder had incorporated into the
present scheme, but the newer part was the more
imposing.</p>
<p class="pnext">The walls were of great thickness and composed
of adobe blocks of huge size. These were
not sun-baked, as is usual in adobe dwellings,
but had been burned like brick in a furnace constructed
for the purpose by the first proprietor,
and were therefore much stronger and harder
than ordinary brick. In this climate there is no
dampness clinging to such a structure and the
rooms were extraordinarily cool in summer and
warm in the chill winter season. Surrounding
the house were many magnificent trees of tropical
and semi-tropical nature, all of which had
now attained their full prime. On the south and
east sides were extensive rose gardens and beds
of flowers in wonderful variety.</p>
<p class="pnext">It was here that the last Señor Cristoval had
brought his young bride, a lady of Madrid who
was reputed to have possessed great beauty; but
seclusion in this retired spot, then much isolated,
rendered her so unhappy that she became mentally
unbalanced and in a fit of depression took
her own life. Cristoval, until then a generous
and noble man, was completely changed by this
catastrophe. During the remainder of his life
he was noted for parsimony and greed for
money, not unmixed with cruelty. He worked
his ignorant Indian and Mexican servants mercilessly,
denying them proper food or wage, and
his death was a relief to all. Afterward the big
estate was cut up and passed into various hands.
Three hundred acres of fine orange and olive
groves, including the spacious mansion, were
finally sold to young Arthur Weldon.</p>
<p class="pnext">“It’s an awfully big place,” said Louise, as
the party alighted and stood upon the broad
stone veranda, “but it is so quaint and charming
that I love every stick and stone of it.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“The baby!” shrieked Patsy.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Where’s that blessed baby?” cried Beth.</p>
<p class="pnext">Then came from the house a dusky maid bearing
in her arms a soft, fluffy bundle that was
instantly pounced upon by the two girls, to Uncle
John’s horror and dismay.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Be careful, there!” he called. “You’ll
smother the poor thing.”
But Louise laughed and regarded the scene
delightedly. And little Jane seemed to appreciate
the importance of the occasion, for she waved
her tiny hands and cooed a welcome to her two
new aunties.</p>
</div>
<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-iiithat-blessed-baby">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id4">CHAPTER III—THAT BLESSED BABY!</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">“Oh, you darling!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“It’s my turn, Patsy! Don’t be selfish. Let
me kiss her again.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“That’s enough, Beth. Here—give me my
niece!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“She’s mine, too.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Give me that baby! There; you’ve made
her cry.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I haven’t; she’s laughing because I kissed
her wee nose.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Isn’t she a dear, though?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Now, girls,” suggested Louise, “suppose we
give Uncle John and the major a peep at her.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Reluctantly the bundle was abandoned to its
mother, who carried it to where Mr. Merrick
was nervously standing.
“Yes, yes,” he said, touching one cheek gently
with the tip of his finger. “It—it’s a fine child,
Louise; really a—a—creditable child. But—eh—isn’t
it rather—soft?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Of course, Uncle John. All babies are soft.
Aren’t you going to kiss little Jane?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“It—won’t—hurt it?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Not a bit. Haven’t Beth and Patsy nearly
kissed its skin off?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Babies,” asserted Major Doyle, stiffly,
“were made to be kissed. Anyhow, that’s the
penalty they pay for being born helpless.” And
with this he kissed little Jane on both cheeks
with evident satisfaction.</p>
<p class="pnext">This bravado encouraged Uncle John to do
likewise, but after the operation he looked sheepish
and awkward, as if he felt that he had taken
an unfair advantage of the wee lady.</p>
<p class="pnext">“She seems very red, Louise,” he remarked,
to cover his embarrassment.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, no, Uncle! Everyone says she’s the
whitest baby of her age they ever saw. She’s
only five months old, remember.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Dear me; how very young.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But she’s getting older every day,” said
Arthur, coming in from the garage. “What do
you folks think of her, anyhow?”</p>
<p class="pnext">The rhapsodies were fairly bewildering, yet
very pleasant to the young father and mother.
While they continued, Mildred Travers quietly
took the child from Louise and tenderly bent
over it. Only the major noted the little scene
that ensued.</p>
<p class="pnext">The eyes of the dark-skinned Mexican girl
flashed sudden fire. She pulled Mildred’s sleeve
and then fell back discomfited as the cold,
fathomless eyes of the trained nurse met her
own. For an instant the girl stood irresolute;
then with a quick, unexpected motion she tore
the infant from Mildred’s arms and rushed into
the house with it.</p>
<p class="pnext">Arthur, noticing this last action, laughed
lightly. The major frowned. Mildred folded
her arms and stood in the background unmoved
and unobtrusive. Louise was chatting volubly
with her two cousins.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Was that the same Mexican girl who fed
the baby chile con carne?” inquired Uncle John
anxiously.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Mercy, no!” cried Arthur. “What ever
put such an idea into your head?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I believe the major suggested it,” replied
the little man. “Anyhow, it was something hot,
so Louise wrote.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, yes; when Toodlums had the colic. It
was some queer Mexican remedy, but I’m confident
it saved the child’s life. The girl is a
treasure.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Uncle John coughed and glanced uneasily at
Miss Travers, who pretended not to have overheard
this conversation. But the major was
highly amused and decided it was a good joke
on Mr. Merrick. It was so good a joke that it
might serve as a basis for many cutting remarks
in future discussions. His brother-in-law
was so seldom guilty of an error in judgment
that Major Doyle, who loved to oppose him because
he was so fond of him, hailed Uncle John’s
present predicament with pure joy.</p>
<p class="pnext">Louise created a welcome diversion by ushering
them all into the house and through the
stately rooms to the open court, where a luncheon
table was set beneath the shade of the palms.</p>
<p class="pnext">Here was the baby again, with the Mexican
girl, Inez, hugging it defiantly to her bosom as
she sat upon a stone bench.</p>
<p class="pnext">Between the infant, the excitement of arrival
and admiration for the Weldon establishment,
so far surpassing their most ardent anticipations,
Beth and Patsy had little desire for food.
Uncle John and the major, however, did ample
justice to an excellent repast, which was served
by two more Mexican maids.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Do you employ only Mexicans for servants?”
inquired Uncle John, when finally the
men were left alone to smoke while the girls,
under Louise’s guidance, explored the house.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Only Mexicans, except for the Chinese
cook,” replied Arthur. “It is impossible to get
American help and the Japs I won’t have. Some
of the ranch hands have been on the place for
years, but the house servants I hired after I come
here.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“A lazy lot, eh?” suggested the major.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Quite right, sir. But I find them faithful
and easy to manage. You will notice that I keep
two or three times as many house servants as a
similar establishment would require in the east;
but they are content with much smaller wages.
It’s the same way on the ranch. Yet without
the Mexicans the help problem would be a serious
one out here.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Does the ranch pay?” asked Mr. Merrick.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I haven’t been here long enough to find out,”
answered Arthur, with a smile. “So far, I’ve
done all the paying. We shall harvest a big
orange crop next month, and in time the olives
will mature; but I’ve an idea the expenses will
eat up the receipts, by the end of the year.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“No money in a California ranch, eh?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Why, some of my neighbors are making
fortunes, I hear; but they are experienced ranchers.
On the other hand, my next neighbor at
the north is nearly bankrupt, because he’s a
greenhorn from the east. Some time, when I’ve
learned the game, I hope to make this place
something more than a plaything.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You’ll stay here, then?” asked the major,
with astonishment.
“It’s the most delightful country on earth,
for a residence. You’ll admit that, sir, when
you know it better.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Meantime the baggage wagon arrived and
Patsy and Beth, having picked out their rooms,
began to unpack and “settle” in their new
quarters.</p>

<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id5">CHAPTER IV—LITTLE JANE’S TWO NURSES</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">Louise had been considerably puzzled to account
for the presence of the strange girl in
Uncle John’s party. At first she did not know
whether to receive Mildred Travers as an equal
or a dependent. Not until the three nieces were
seated together in Louise’s own room, exchanging
girlish confidences, was Mildred’s status
clearly defined to the young mother.</p>
<p class="pnext">“You see,” explained Patsy, “Uncle John
was dreadfully worried over the baby. When
you wrote of that terrible time the dear little one
had with the colic, and how you were dependent
on a Mexican girl who fed the innocent lamb
some horrid hot stuff, Uncle declared it was a
shame to imperil such a precious life, and that
you must have a thoroughly competent nurse.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But,” said Louise, quite bewildered, “I’m
afraid you don’t understand that—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“And so,” broke in Beth, “I told him I knew
of a perfect jewel of a trained nurse, who knows
as much as most doctors and could guard the
baby from a thousand dangers. I’d watched her
care for one of our poor girls who was knocked
down by an automobile and badly injured, and
Mildred was so skillful and sympathetic that she
quite won my heart. I wasn’t sure, at first, she’d
come way out to California, to stay, but when
I broached the subject she cried out: ‘Thank
heaven!’ in such a heart-felt, joyous tone that
I was greatly relieved. So we brought her
along, and—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Really, Beth, I don’t need her,” protested
Louise. “The Mexicans are considered the
best nurses in the world, and Inez is perfectly
devoted to baby and worships her most sinfully.
I got her from a woman who formerly employed
her as a nurse and she gave Inez a splendid
recommendation. Both Arthur and I believe she
saved baby’s life by her prompt action when the
colic caught her.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But the hot stuff!” cried Patsy.</p>
<p class="pnext">“It might have ruined baby’s stomach for
life,” asserted Beth.</p>
<p class="pnext">“No; it’s a simple Mexican remedy that is
very efficient. Perhaps, in my anxiety, I wrote
more forcibly than the occasion justified,” admitted
Louise; “but I have every confidence
in Inez.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The girls were really dismayed and frankly
displayed their chagrin. Louise laughed at
them.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Never mind,” she said; “it’s just one of
dear Uncle John’s blunders in trying to be
good to me; so let’s endeavor to wiggle out of
the hole as gracefully as possible.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I don’t see how you’ll do it,” confessed
Patsy. “Here’s Mildred, permanently engaged
and all expenses paid.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“She is really a superior person, as you’ll
presently discover,” added Beth. “I’ve never
dared question her as to her family history, but
I venture to say she is well born and with just
as good antecedents as we have—perhaps
better.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“She’s very quiet and undemonstrative,”
said Patsy musingly.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Naturally, being a trained nurse. I liked
her face,” said Louise, “but her eyes puzzle
me.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“They are her one unfortunate feature,”
Beth agreed.</p>
<p class="pnext">“They’re cold,” said Patsy; “that’s the
trouble. You never get <em class="italics">into</em> her eyes, somehow.
They repel you.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I never look at them,” said Beth. “Her
mouth is sweet and sensitive and her facial expression
pleasant. She moves as gracefully and
silently as—as—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“As a cat,” suggested Patsy.</p>
<p class="pnext">“And she is acquainted with all the modern
methods of nursing, although she’s done a lot
of hospital work, too.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well,” said Louise, reflectively, “I’ll talk
it over with Arthur and see what we can do. Perhaps
baby needs two nurses. We can’t discharge
Inez, for Toodlums is even more contented with
her than with me; but I admit it will be a satisfaction
to have so thoroughly competent a nurse
as Miss Travers at hand in case of emergency.
And, above all else, I don’t want to hurt dear
Uncle John’s feelings.”</p>
<p class="pnext">She did talk it over with Arthur, an hour
later, and her boy husband declared he had
“sized up the situation” the moment he laid
eyes on Mildred at the depot. They owed a lot
to Uncle John, he added, and the most graceful
thing they could do, under the circumstances,
was to instal Miss Travers as head nurse and
retain Inez as her assistant.</p>
<p class="pnext">“The chances are,” said Arthur laughingly,
“that the Mexican girl will have most of the
care of Toodlums, as she does now, while the
superior will remain content to advise Inez and
keep a general supervision over the nursery. So
fix it up that way, Louise, and everybody will
be happy.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Uncle John was thanked so heartily for his
thoughtfulness by the young couple that his
kindly face glowed with satisfaction, and then
Louise began the task of reconciling the two
nurses to the proposed arrangement and defining
the duties of each.
Mildred Travers inclined her head graciously
and said it was an admirable arrangement and
quite satisfactory to her. But Inez listened
sullenly and her dark eyes glowed with resentment.</p>
<p class="pnext">“You not trust me more, then?” she added.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, yes, Inez; we trust you as much as ever,”
Louise assured her.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Then why you hire this strange woman?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“She is a present to us, from my Uncle John,
who came this morning. He didn’t know you
were here, you see, or he would not have brought
her.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Inez remained unmollified.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Miss Travers is a very skillful baby doctor,”
continued Louise, “and she can mend broken
bones, cure diseases and make the sick well.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Inez nodded.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I know. A witch-woman,” she said in a
whisper. “You can trust me señora, but you
cannot trust her. No witch-woman can be
trusted.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Louise smiled but thought best not to argue the
point farther. Inez went back to the nursery
hugging Toodlums as jealously as if she feared
some one would snatch the little one from her
arms.</p>
<p class="pnext">Next morning Mildred said to Beth, in whom
she confided most:</p>
<p class="pnext">“The Mexican girl does not like me. She is
devotedly attached to the baby and fears I will
supplant her.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“That is true,” admitted Beth, who had conceived
the same idea; “but you mustn’t mind her,
Mildred. The poor thing’s only half civilized
and doesn’t understand our ways very well. What
do you think of little Jane?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I never knew a sweeter, healthier or more
contented baby. She smiles and sleeps perpetually
and seems thoroughly wholesome. Were she
to remain in her present robust condition there
would be little need of my services, I assure you.
But—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But what?” asked Beth anxiously, as the
nurse hesitated.</p>
<p class="pnext">“All babies have their ills, and little Jane cannot
escape them. The rainy season is approaching
and dampness is trying to infants. There will
be months of moisture, and then—I shall be
needed.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Have you been in California before?” asked
Beth, impressed by Mildred’s positive assertion.</p>
<p class="pnext">The girl hesitated a moment, looking down.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I was born here,” she said in low, tense tones.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Indeed! Why, I thought all the white people
in California came from the east. I had no
idea there could be such a thing as a white native.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred smiled with her lips. Her imperturbable
eyes never smiled.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I am only nineteen, in spite of my years of
training and hard work,” she said, a touch of bitterness
in her voice. “My father came here
nearly thirty years ago.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“To Southern California?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Did you live near here, then?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred looked around her.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I have been in this house often, as a girl,”
she said slowly. “Señor Cristoval was—an acquaintance
of my father.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Beth stared at her, greatly interested.</p>
<p class="pnext">“How strange!” she exclaimed. “You cannot be far from
your own family, then,” she
added.</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred shivered a little, twisting her fingers
nervously together. She was indeed sensitive,
despite that calm, repellent look in her eyes.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I hope,” she said, evading Beth’s remark, “to
be of real use to this dear baby, whom I already
love. The Mexican girl, Inez, is well enough as
a caretaker, but her judgment could not be trusted
in emergencies. These Mexicans lose their heads
easily and in crises are liable to do more harm
than good. Mrs. Weldon’s arrangement is an
admirable one and I confess it relieves me of
much drudgery and confinement. I shall keep a
watchful supervision over my charge and be prepared
to meet any emergency.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Beth was not wholly satisfied with this interview.
Mildred had told her just enough to render
her curious, but had withheld any information
as to how a California girl happened to be in
New York working as a trained nurse. She remembered
the girl’s fervent exclamation: “Thank
heaven!” when asked if she would go to Southern
California, to a ranch called El Cajon, to
take care of a new baby. Beth judged from this
that Mildred was eager to get back home again;
yet she had evaded any reference to her family or
former friends, and since her arrival had expressed
no wish to visit them.</p>
<p class="pnext">There was something strange and unaccountable
about the affair, and for this reason Beth refrained
from mentioning to her cousins that Mildred
Travers was a Californian by birth and was
familiar with the scenes around El Cajon ranch
and even with the old house itself. Perhaps some
day the girl would tell her more, when she would
be able to relate the whole story to Patsy and
Louise.</p>
<p class="pnext">Of course the new arrivals were eager to inspect
the orange and olive groves, so on the day following
that of their arrival the entire party prepared
to join Arthur Weldon in a tramp over the three
hundred acre ranch.</p>
<p class="pnext">A little way back of the grounds devoted to the
residence and gardens began the orange groves,
the dark green foliage just now hung thick with
fruit, some green, some pale yellow and others of
that deep orange hue which denotes full maturity.
“They consider five acres of oranges a pretty
fair ranch, out here,” said the young proprietor;
“but I have a hundred and ten acres of bearing
trees. It will take a good many freight cars to
carry my oranges to the eastern markets.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“And what a job to pick them all!” exclaimed
Patsy.</p>
<p class="pnext">“We don’t pick them,” said Arthur. “I sell
the crop on the trees and the purchaser sends a
crew of men who gather the fruit in quick order.
They are taken to big warehouses and sorted into
sizes, wrapped and packed and loaded onto cars.
That is a separate branch of the business with
which we growers have nothing to do.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Between the orange and the olive groves, and
facing a little lane, they came upon a group of
adobe huts—a little village in itself. Many
children were playing about the yards, while several
stalwart Mexicans lounged in the shade
quietly smoking their eternal cigarettes. Women
appeared in the doorways, shading their eyes with
their hands as they curiously examined the approaching
strangers.</p>
<p class="pnext">Only one man, a small, wiry fellow with plump
brown cheeks and hair and beard of snowy whiteness,
detached himself from the group and advanced
to meet his master. Removing his wide
sombrero he made a sweeping bow, a gesture so
comical that Patsy nearly laughed aloud.</p>
<p class="pnext">“This is Miguel Zaloa, the ranchero, who has
charge of all my men,” said Arthur. Then, addressing
the man, he asked: “Any news,
Miguel?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Ever’thing all right, Meest Weld,” replied
the ranchero, his bright eyes earnestly fixed upon
his employer’s face. “Some pardon, señor; but—Mees
Jane is well?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Quite well, thank you, Miguel.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Mees Jane,” said the man, shyly twirling his
hat in his hands as he cast an upward glance at
the young ladies, “ees cherub young lade; much
love an’ beaut’ful. Ees not?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“She’s a dear,” replied Patsy, with ready sympathy
for the sentiment and greatly pleased to find
the man so ardent an admirer of the baby.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Ever’bod’ love Mees Jane,” continued old
Miguel, simply. “Since she have came, sun ees
more bright, air ees more good, tamale ees more
sweet. Will Inez bring Mees Jane to see us to-day,
Meest Weld?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Perhaps so,” laughed Arthur; and then, as
he turned to lead them to the olive trees, Louise,
blushing prettily at the praise bestowed upon her
darling, pressed a piece of shining silver into old
Miguel’s hand—which he grasped with alacrity
and another low bow.</p>
<p class="pnext">“No doubt he’s right about little Jane,” remarked
the major, when they had passed beyond
earshot, “but I’ve a faint suspicion the old bandit
praised her in order to get the money.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, no!” cried Louise; “he’s really sincere.
It is quite wonderful how completely all our
Mexicans are wrapped up in baby. If Inez
doesn’t wheel the baby-cab over to the quarters
every day, they come to the house in droves to
inquire if ‘Mees Jane’ is well. Their love for her
is almost pathetic.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Don’t the fellows ever work?” inquired
Uncle John.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes, indeed,” said Arthur. “Have you any
fault to find with the condition of this ranch? As
compared with many others it is a model of perfection.
At daybreak the mules are cultivating
the earth around the trees; when the sun gets low
the irrigating begins. We keep the harrows and
the pumps busy every day. But during the hours
when the sun shines brightest the Mexicans do
not love to work, and it is policy—so long as
they accomplish their tasks—to allow them to
choose their own hours for labor.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“They seem a shiftless lot,” said the major.</p>
<p class="pnext">“They’re as good as their average type. But
some—old Miguel, for instance—are better
than the ordinary. Miguel is really a clever and
industrious fellow. He has lived here practically
all his life and knows intimately every tree on the
place.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Did he serve the old Spanish don—Cristoval?”
asked Beth.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes; and his father before him. I’ve often
wondered how old Miguel is. According to his
own story he must be nearly a hundred; but that’s
absurd. Anyhow, he’s a faithful, capable fellow,
and rules the others with the rigor of an
autocrat. I don’t know what I should do without
him.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You seem to have purchased a lot of things
with this ranch,” observed Uncle John. “A capital
old mansion, a band of trained servants, and—a
ghost.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, yes!” exclaimed Louise. “Major, did
the ghost bother you last night?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Not to my knowledge,” said the old soldier.
“I was too tired to keep awake, you know; therefore
his ghostship could not have disturbed me
without being unusually energetic.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Have you ever seen the ghost, Louise?” inquired
Patsy.</p>
<p class="pnext">“No, dear, nor even heard it. But Arthur has.
It’s in the blue room, you know, near Arthur’s
study—one of the prettiest rooms in the house.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“That’s why we gave it to the major,” added
Arthur. “Once or twice, when I’ve been sitting
in the study, at about midnight, reading and
smoking my pipe, I’ve heard some queer noises
coming from the blue room; but I attribute them
to rats. These old houses are full of the pests
and we can’t manage to get rid of them.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I imagine the walls are not all solid,” explained
Louise, “for some of those on the outside
are from six to eight feet in thickness, and it
would be folly to make them of solid adobe.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“As for that, adobe costs nothing,” said
Arthur, “and it would be far cheaper to make a
solid wall than a hollow one. But between the
blocks are a lot of spaces favored as residences
by our enemies the rats, and there they are safe
from our reach.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But the ghost?” demanded Patsy.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, the ghost exists merely in the minds of
the simple Mexicans, over there at the quarters.
Most of them were here when that rascally old
Cristoval died, and no money would hire one of
them to sleep in the house. You see, they feared
and hated the old fellow, who doubtless treated
them cruelly. That is why we had to get our
house servants from a distance, and even then
we had some difficulty in quieting their fears
when they heard the ghost tales. Little Inez,”
added Louise, “is especially superstitious, and
I’m sure if she were not so devoted to baby she
would have left us weeks ago.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Inez told me this morning,” said Beth, “that
the major must be a very brave man and possessed
some charm that protected him from ghosts, or
he would never dare sleep in the blue room.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I have a charm,” declared the major, gravely,
“and it’s just common sense.”</p>
<p class="pnext">But now they were among the graceful, broad-spreading
olives, at this season barren of fruit
but very attractive in their gray-green foliage.
Arthur had to explain all about olive culture to
the ignorant Easterners and he did this with much
satisfaction because he had so recently acquired
the knowledge himself.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I can see,” said Uncle John, “that your
ranch is to be a great gamble. In good years, you
win; a crop failure will cost you a fortune.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“True,” admitted the young man; “but an absolute
crop failure is unknown in this section.
Some years are better than others, but all are
good years.”</p>
<p class="pnext">It was quite a long tramp, but a very pleasant
one, and by the time they returned to the house
everyone was ready for luncheon, which awaited
them in the shady court, beside the splashing
fountain. Patsy and Beth demanded the baby,
so presently Inez came with little Jane, and Mildred
Travers followed after. The two nurses did
not seem on very friendly terms, for the Mexican
girl glared fiercely at her rival and Mildred returned
a basilisk stare that would have confounded
anyone less defiant.</p>
<p class="pnext">This evident hostility amused Patsy, annoyed
Beth and worried Louise; but the baby was impartial.
From her seat on Inez’ lap little Jane
stretched out her tiny hands to Mildred, smiling
divinely, and the nurse took the child in spite
of Inez’ weak resistance, fondling the little one
lovingly. There was a sharp contrast between
Mildred’s expert and adroit handling of the child
and Inez’ tender awkwardness, and this was so
evident that all present noticed it.</p>
<p class="pnext">Perhaps Inez herself felt this difference as,
sullen and jealous, she eyed the other intently.
Then little Jane transferred her favors to her
former nurse and held out her hands to Inez.
With a cry that was half a sob the girl caught the
baby in her arms and held it so closely that Patsy
had hard work to make her give it up.</p>
<p class="pnext">By the time Uncle John had finished his lunch
both Patsy and Beth had taken turns holding the
fascinating “Toodlums,” and now the latter
plunged Jane into Mr. Merrick’s lap and warned
him to be very careful.</p>
<p class="pnext">Uncle John was embarrassed but greatly delighted.
He cooed and clucked to the baby until
it fairly laughed aloud with glee, and then he
made faces until the infant became startled and
regarded him with grave suspicion.</p>
<p class="pnext">“If you’ve done making an old fool of yourself,
sir,” said the major severely, “you’ll oblige
me by handing over my niece.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“<em class="italics">Your</em> niece!” was the indignant reply; “she’s
nothing of the sort. Jane is <em class="italics">my</em> niece.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“No more than mine,” insisted the major;
“and you’re worrying her. Will you hand her
over, you selfish man, or must I take her by
force?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Uncle John reluctantly submitted to the divorce
and the major handled the baby as if she had been
glass.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Ye see,” he remarked, lapsing slightly into
his Irish brogue, as he was apt to do when much
interested, “I’ve raised a daughter meself, which
John Merrick hasn’t, and I know the ways of the
wee women. They know very well when a friend
has ’em, and—Ouch! Leg-go, I say!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Little Jane had his grizzly moustache fast in
two chubby fists and the major’s howls aroused
peals of laughter.</p>
<p class="pnext">Uncle John nearly rolled from his chair in an
ecstacy of delight and he could have shaken Mildred
Travers for releasing the grip of the baby
fingers and rescuing the major from torture.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Laugh, ye satyr!” growled the major,
wiping the tears from his own eyes. “It’s lucky
you have no hair nor whiskers—any more than
an egg—or you’d be writhing in agony before
now.” He turned to look wonderingly at the
crowing baby in Mildred’s arms. “It’s a female
Sandow!” he averred. “The grip of her hands
is something marvelous!”</p>
</div>
<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-vinez-threatens">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id6">CHAPTER V—INEZ THREATENS</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">“Yes,” said Louise, a week later, “we all make
fools of ourselves over Toodlums, Really, girls,
Jane is a very winning baby. I don’t say that
because I’m her mother, understand. If she were
anyone else’s baby, I’d say the same thing.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Of course,” agreed Patsy. “I don’t believe
such a baby was ever before born. She’s so
happy, and sweet, and—and—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“And comfortable,” said Beth. “Indeed, Jane
is a born sorceress; she bewitches everyone who
beholds her dear dimpled face. This is an impartial
opinion, you know; I’d say the same thing
if I were not her adoring auntie.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“It’s true,” Patsy declared. “Even the Mexicans
worship her. And Mildred Travers—the
sphinx—whose blood I am sure is ice-water, displays
a devotion for baby that is absolutely
amazing. I don’t blame her, you know, for it
must be a real delight to care for such a fairy.
I’m surprised, Louise, that you can bear to have
baby out of your sight so much of the time.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Louise laughed lightly.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’m not such an unfeeling mother as you
think,” she answered. “I know just where baby
is every minute and she is never out of my
thoughts. However, with two nurses, both very
competent, to care for Toodlums, I do not think
it necessary to hold her in my lap every moment.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Here Uncle John and the major approached
the palm, under which the three nieces were sitting,
and Mr. Merrick exclaimed:</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’ll bet a cookie you were talking of baby
Jane.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You’d win, then,” replied Patsy. “There’s
no other topic of conversation half so delightful.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Jane,” observed the major, musingly, as he
seated himself in a rustic chair. “A queer name
for a baby, Louise. Whatever possessed you to
burden the poor infant with it?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Burden? Nonsense, Major! It’s a charming
name,” cried Patsy.</p>
<p class="pnext">“She is named after poor Aunt Jane,” said
Louise.</p>
<p class="pnext">A silence somewhat awkward followed.</p>
<p class="pnext">“My sister Jane,” remarked Uncle John
gravely, “was in some respects an admirable
woman.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“And in many others detestable,” said Beth
in frank protest. “The only good thing I can
remember about Aunt Jane,” she added, “is that
she brought us three girls together, when we had
previously been almost unaware of one anothers’
existence. And she made us acquainted with
Uncle John.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Then she did us another favor,” added Patsy.
“She died.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Poor Aunt Jane!” sighed Louise. “I wish
I could say something to prove that I revere her
memory. Had the baby been a boy, its name
would have been John; but being a girl I named
her for Uncle John’s sister—the highest compliment
I could conceive.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Uncle John nodded gratefully. “I wasn’t especially
fond of Jane, myself,” said he, “but it’s
a family name and I’m glad you gave it to baby.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Jane Merrick,” said the major, “was very
cruel to Patsy and to me, and so I’m sorry you
gave her name to baby.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Always contrary, eh?” returned Uncle
John, with a tolerant smile, for he was in no
wise disturbed by this adverse criticism of his defunct
sister—a criticism that in fact admitted
little argument. “But it occurs to me that the
most peculiar thing about this name is that you
three girls, who were once Aunt Jane’s nieces,
are now Niece Jane’s aunts!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Except me,” smiled Louise. “I’m happy to
claim a closer relationship. But returning to our
discussion of Aunt Jane. She was really instrumental
in making our fortunes as well as in promoting
our happiness, so I have no regret because
I made baby her namesake.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“The name of Jane,” said Patsy, “is in itself
beautiful, because it is simple and old-fashioned.
Now that it is connected with my chubby niece it
will derive a new and added luster.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Quite true,” declared Uncle John.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Where is Arthur?” inquired the major.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Writing his weekly batch of letters,” replied
Arthur’s wife. “When they are ready he is to
drive us all over to town in the big car, and we
have planned to have lunch there and to return
home in the cool of the evening. Will that program
please our guests?”</p>
<p class="pnext">All voiced their approval and presently Arthur
appeared with his letters and bade them get ready
for the ride, while he brought out the car. He
always drove the machine himself, as no one on
the place was competent to act as chauffeur; but
he managed it admirably and enjoyed driving.</p>
<p class="pnext">Louise went to the nursery to kiss little Jane.
The baby lay in her crib, fast asleep. Near her
sat Mildred Travers, reading a book. Crouched
in the window-seat was Inez, hugging her knees
and gazing moodily out into the garden.</p>
<p class="pnext">The nursery was in the East Wing, facing the
courtyard but also looking upon the rose garden,
its one deep-set window being near a corner of
the room. On one side it connected with a small
chamber used by Inez, which occupied half the
depth of the wing and faced the garden. The
other half of the space was taken by a small
sewing-room letting out upon the court.</p>
<p class="pnext">At the opposite side of little Jane’s nursery was
a roomy chamber which had been given up to Mildred,
and still beyond this were the rooms occupied
by Arthur and Louise, all upon the ground
floor. By this arrangement the baby had a nurse
on either side and was only one room removed
from its parents.</p>
<p class="pnext">This wing was said to be the oldest part of the
mansion, a fact attested by the great thickness of
the walls. Just above was the famous blue room
occupied by the major, where ghosts were supposed
at times to hold their revels. Yet, despite
its clumsy construction, the East Wing was
cheery and pleasant in all its rooms and sunlight
flooded it the year round.</p>
<p class="pnext">After the master and mistress had driven away
to town with their guests, Inez sat for a time by
the window, still motionless save for an occasional
wicked glance over her shoulder at Mildred,
who read placidly as she rocked to and fro
in her chair. The presence of the American nurse
seemed to oppress the girl, for not a semblance of
friendship had yet developed between the two;
so presently Inez rose and glided softly out into
the court, leaving Mildred to watch the sleeping
baby.</p>
<p class="pnext">She took the path that led to the Mexican quarters
and ten minutes later entered the hut where
Bella, the skinny old hag who was the wife to
Miguel Zaloa, was busy with her work.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Ah, Inez. But where ees Mees Jane?” was
the eager inquiry.</p>
<p class="pnext">Inez glanced around to find several moustached
faces in the doorway. Every dark, earnest eye
repeated the old woman’s question. The girl
shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p class="pnext">“She is care for by the new nurse, Meeldred.
I left her sleeping.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Who sleeps, Inez?” demanded the aged
Miguel. “Ees it the new nurse, or Mees Jane?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Both, perhap.” She laughed scornfully and
went out to the shed that connected two of the
adobe dwellings and served as a shady lounging
place. Here a group quickly formed around her,
including those who followed from the hut.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I shall kill her, some day,” declared the girl,
showing her gleaming teeth. “What right have
she to come an’ take our baby?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Miguel stroked his white moustache reflectively.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Ees this Meeldred good to Mees Jane?” he
asked.</p>
<p class="pnext">“When anyone looks, yes,” replied Inez reluctantly.
“She fool even baby, some time, who
laugh at her. But poor baby do not know. I
know. This Meeldred ees a devil!” she hissed.</p>
<p class="pnext">The listening group displayed no emotion at
this avowal. They eyed the girl attentively, as if
expecting to hear more. But Inez, having vented
her spite, now sulked.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Where she came from?” asked Miguel, the
recognized spokesman.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Back there. New York,” tossing her head
in an easterly direction.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Why she come?” continued the old man.</p>
<p class="pnext">“The little mans with no hair—Meest Merrick—he
think I not know about babies. He
think this girl who learns babies in school, an’
from books, know more than me who has care
for many baby—but for none like our Mees
Jane. Mees Jane ees angel!”</p>
<p class="pnext">They all nodded in unison, approving her assertion.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Eet ees not bad thought, that,” remarked old
Bella. “Books an’ schools ees good to teach
wisdom.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Pah! Not for babies,” objected her husband,
shaking his head. “Book an’ school can not
grow orange, either. To do a thing many time
ees to know it better than a book can know.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Besides,” said Inez, “this Meeldred ees
witch-woman.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I know it. She come from New York. But
yesterday she say to me: ‘Let us wheel leetle
Jane to the live oak at Burney’s.’ How can she
know there is live oak at Burney’s? Then, the
first day she come, she say: ‘Take baby’s milk
into vault under your room an’ put on stone shelf
to keep cool.’ I, who live here, do not know of
such a vault. She show me some stone steps in
one corner, an’ she push against stone wall. Then
wall open like door, an’ I find vault. But how she
know it, unless she is witch-woman?”</p>
<p class="pnext">There was a murmur of astonishment. Old
Miguel scratched his head as if puzzled.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I, too, know about thees vault,” said he;
“but then, eet ees I know all of the old house, as
no one else know. Once I live there with Señor
Cristoval. But how can thees New York girl
know?”</p>
<p class="pnext">There was no answer. Merely puzzled looks.</p>
<p class="pnext">“What name has she, Inez?” suddenly asked
Miguel.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Travers. Meeldred Travers.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The old man thought deeply and then shook his
head with a sigh.</p>
<p class="pnext">“In seexty year there be no Travers near El
Cajon,” he asserted. “I thought maybe she
have been here before. But no. Even in old days
there ees no Travers come here.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“There ees a Travers Ranch over at the north,”
asserted Bella.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Eet ees a name; there be no Travers live
there,” declared Miguel, still with that puzzled
look upon his plump features.</p>
<p class="pnext">Inez laughed at him.</p>
<p class="pnext">“She is witch-woman, I tell you. I know it!
Look in her eyes, an’ see.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The group of Mexicans moved uneasily. Old
Miguel deliberately rolled a cigarette and lighted
it.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Thees woman I have not yet see,” he announced,
after due reflection. “But, if she ees
witch-woman, eet ees bad for Mees Jane to be
near her.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“That is what <em class="italics">I</em> say!” cried Inez eagerly. She
spoke better English than the others. “She will
bewitch my baby; she will make it sickly, so it will
die!” And she wrung her hands in piteous misery.</p>
<p class="pnext">The Mexicans exchanged frightened looks.
Old Bella alone seemed unaffected.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Mees Weld own her baby—not us,” suggested
Miguel’s wife. “If Mees Weld theenk
thees girl is safe nurse, what have we to say—eh?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I say she shall not kill my baby!” cried Inez
fiercely. “That is what <em class="italics">I</em> say, Bella. Before
she do that, I kill thees Meeldred Travers.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Miguel examined the girl’s face intently.</p>
<p class="pnext">“You are fool, Inez,” he asserted. “It ees
bad to keel anything—even thees New York
witch-woman. Be compose an’ keep watch.
Nothing harm Mees Jane if you watch. Where
are your folks, girl?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Live in San Diego,” replied Inez, again sullen.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Once I know your father. He ees good man,
but drink too much. If you make quarrel about
thees new nurse, you get sent home. Then you
lose Mees Jane. So keep compose, an’ watch. If
you see anything wrong, come to me an’ tell it.
That ees best.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Inez glanced around the group defiantly, but all
nodded approval of old Miguel’s advice. She rose
from the bench where she was seated, shrugged
her shoulders disdainfully and walked away
without a word.</p>

<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-via-dinner-with-the-neighbors">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id7">CHAPTER VI—A DINNER WITH THE NEIGHBORS</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">Escondido, the nearest town and post office to
El Cajon Ranch, is a quaint little place with a
decided Mexican atmosphere. Those California
inhabitants whom we call, for convenience,
“Mexicans,” are not all natives of Mexico, by
any means. Most of them are a mixed breed derived
from the early Spanish settlers and the
native Indian tribes—both alike practically extinct
in this locality—and have never stepped
foot in Mexican territory, although the boundary
line is not far distant. Because the true Mexican
is generally a similar admixture of Indian and
Spaniard, it is customary to call these Californians
by the same appellation. The early
Spaniards left a strong impress upon this state,
and even in the newly settled districts the Spanish
architecture appropriately prevails, as typical of
a semi-tropical country which owed its first civilizing
influences to old Spain.</p>
<p class="pnext">The houses of Escondido are a queer mingling
of modern bungalows and antique adobe dwellings.
Even the business street shows many adobe
structures. A quiet, dreamy little town, with a
comfortable hotel and excellent stores, it is much
frequented by the wealthy ranchers in its neighborhood.</p>
<p class="pnext">After stopping at the post office, Arthur drove
down a little side street to a weather-beaten, unprepossessing
building which bore the word
“Restaurant” painted in dim white letters upon
its one window. Here he halted the machine.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh,” said Beth, drawing a long breath. “Is
this one of your little jokes, Arthur?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“A joke? Didn’t we come for luncheon,
then?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“We did, and I’m ravenous,” said Patsy.
“But you informed us that there is a good hotel
here, on the main street.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“So there is,” admitted Arthur; “but it’s like
all hotels. Now, this is—different. If you’re
hungry; if you want a treat—something out of
the ordinary—just follow me.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Louise was laughing at their doubting expressions
and this care-free levity led them to obey
their host’s injunction. Then the dingy door
opened and out stepped a young fellow whom
the girls decided must be either a cowboy or a
clever imitation of one.</p>
<p class="pnext">He seemed very young—a mere boy—for all
his stout little form. He was bareheaded and a
shock of light, tow-colored hair was in picturesque
disarray. A blue flannel shirt, rolled up at the
sleeves, a pair of drab corduroy trousers and
rough shoes completed his attire. Pausing awkwardly
in the doorway, he first flushed red and
then advanced boldly to shake Arthur’s hand.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Why, Weldon, this is an unexpected pleasure,”
he exclaimed in a pleasant voice that belied
his rude costume, for its tones were well modulated
and cultured. “I’ve been trying to call you
up for three days, but something is wrong with
the line. How’s baby?”</p>
<p class="pnext">This last question was addressed to Louise,
who shook the youth’s hand cordially.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Baby is thriving finely,” she reported, and
then introduced her friends to Mr. Rudolph
Hahn, who, she explained, was one of their nearest
neighbors.</p>
<p class="pnext">“We almost crowd the Weldons,” he said,
“for our house is only five miles distant from
theirs; so we’ve been getting quite chummy since
they moved to El Cajon. Helen—that’s my
wife, you know—is an humble worshiper at the
shrine of Miss Jane Weldon, as we all are, in
fact.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Your wife!” cried Patsy in surprise.</p>
<p class="pnext">He laughed.</p>
<p class="pnext">“You think I’m an infant, only fit to play with
Jane,” said he; “but I assure you I could vote,
if I wanted to—which I don’t. I think, sir,”
turning to Uncle John, “that my father knows
you quite well.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Why, surely you’re not the son of Andy
Hahn, the steel king?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I believe they do give him that royal title;
but Dad is only a monarch in finance, and when
he visits my ranch he’s as much a boy as his son.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“It scarcely seems possible,” declared Mr.
Merrick, eyeing the rough costume wonderingly
but also with approval. “How long have you
lived out here?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Six years, sir. I’m an old inhabitant. Weldon,
here, has only been alive for six months.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Alive?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Of course. One breathes, back east, but only
lives in California.”</p>
<p class="pnext">During the laughter that followed this enthusiastic
epigram Arthur ushered the party into
the quaint Spanish restaurant. The room was
clean and neat, despite the fact that the floor was
strewn with sawdust and the tables covered with
white oilcloth. An anxious-eyed, dapper little
man with a foreign face and manner greeted them
effusively and asked in broken English their commands.</p>
<p class="pnext">Arthur ordered the specialties of the house.
“These friends, Castro, are from the far East,
and I’ve told them of your famous cuisine.
Don’t disappoint them.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“May I join you?” asked Rudolph Hahn. “I
wish I’d brought Nell over to-day; she’d have
been delighted with this meeting. But we didn’t
know you were coming. That confounded telephone
doesn’t reach you at all.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’m going over to the office to see about that
telephone,” said Arthur. “I believe I’ll do the
errand while Castro is preparing his compounds.
I’m always uneasy when the telephone is out of
order.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You ought to be,” said Rudolph, “with that
blessed baby in the house. It might save you
thirty precious minutes in getting a doctor.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Does your line work?” asked Louise.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes; it seems to get all connections but yours.
So I imagine something is wrong with your
phone, or near the house.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’ll have them send a repair man out at once,”
said Arthur, and departed for the telephone office,
accompanied by his fellow rancher.</p>
<p class="pnext">While they were gone Louise told them something
of young Hahn’s history. He had eloped,
at seventeen years of age, with his father’s stenographer,
a charming girl of eighteen who belonged
to one of the best families in Washington.
Old Hahn was at first furious and threatened to
disinherit the boy, but when he found the young
bride’s family still more furious and preparing
to annul the marriage on the grounds of the
groom’s youth, the great financier’s mood changed
and he whisked the pair off to California and
bought for them a half-million-dollar ranch,
where they had lived for six years a life of unalloyed
bliss. Having no children of their own,
the Hahns were devoted to little Jane and it was
Rudolph who had given the baby the sobriquet
of “Toodlums.” At almost any time, night or
day, the Hahn automobile was liable to arrive at
El Cajon for a sight of the baby.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Rudolph—we call him ‘Dolph,’ you know—has
not a particle of business instinct,” said
Louise, “so he will never be able to take his
father’s place in the financial world. And he
runs his ranch so extravagantly that it costs the
pater a small fortune every year. Yet they are
agreeable neighbors, artless and unconventional
as children, and surely the great Hahn fortune
won’t suffer much through their inroads.”</p>
<p class="pnext">When Arthur returned he brought with him
still another neighboring ranchman, an enormous
individual fully six feet tall and broad in proportion,
who fairly filled the doorway as he entered.
This man was about thirty years of age, stern of
feature and with shaggy brows that overhung a
pair of peaceful blue eyes which ought to have
been set in the face of some child. This gave
him a whimsical look that almost invariably
evoked a smile when anyone observed him for the
first time. He walked with a vigorous, aggressive
stride and handled his big body with consummate
grace and ease. His bow, when Arthur
introduced him, was that of an old world cavalier.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Here is another of our good friends for you
to know. He’s our neighbor at the north and is
considered the most enterprising orange grower
in all California,” announced Weldon, with a
chuckle that indicated he had said something
funny.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Lemon,” said the man, speaking in such a
shrill, high-pitched tenor voice that the sound
was positively startling, coming from so massive
a chest.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I meant lemon,” Arthur hastened to say.
“Permit me to introduce Mr. Bulwer Runyon,
formerly of New York but now the pride of the
Pacific coast, where his superb oranges—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Lemons,” piped the high, childish voice.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Whose lemons are the sourest and—and—juiciest
ever grown.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What there are of them,” added the man in
a wailing tenor.</p>
<p class="pnext">“We are highly honored to meet Mr. Bulwer
Runyon,” said the major, noticing that the girls
were for once really embarrassed how to greet
this new acquaintance.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Out here,” remarked Dolph Hahn, with a
grin, “we drop the handle to his name and call
him ‘Bul Run’ for short. Sounds sort of patriotic,
you know, and it’s not inappropriate.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You wrong me,” said the big rancher, squeaking
the words cheerfully but at the same time
frowning in a way that might well have terrified
a pirate. “I’m not a bull and I don’t run. It’s
enough exertion to walk. Therefore I ride. My
new car is equipped with one of those remarkable—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Pardon me; we will not discuss your new
car, if you please,” said Arthur. “We wish to
talk of agreeable things. The marvelous Castro
is concocting some of his mysterious dishes and
we wish you to assist us in judging their merits.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I shall be glad to, for I’m pitifully hungry,”
said the tenor voice. “I had breakfast at seven,
you know—like a working man—and the ride
over here in my new six-cylinder machine, which
has a wonderful—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Never mind the machine, please. Forget it,
and try to be sociable,” begged Dolph.</p>
<p class="pnext">“How is the baby, Mrs. Weldon?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well and hearty, Bulwer,” replied Louise.
“Why haven’t you been to see little Jane lately?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I heard you had company,” said Mr. Runyon;
“and the last time I came I stayed three
days and forgot all about my ranch. I’ve made
a will, Mrs. Weldon.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“A will! You’re not going to die, I hope?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I join you in that hope, most fervently, for
I’d hate to leave the new machine and its—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Go on, Bulwer.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But life is fleeting, and no one knows just
when it’ll get to the end of its fleet. Therefore,
as I love the baby better than any other object on
earth—animate or inanimate—except—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Never mind your new car.”</p>
<p class="pnext">He sighed.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Therefore, Mrs. Weldon, I’ve made Jane my
heiress.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, Bul! Aren’t you dreadfully in debt?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes’m.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Is the place worth the mortgage?” inquired
Arthur.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Just about, although the money sharks don’t
think so. But all property out here is rapidly increasing
in value,” declared Runyon, earnestly,
“so, if I can manage to hold on a while longer,
Toodlums will inherit a—a—several fine lemon
trees, at least.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Uncle John was delighted with the big fellow
with the small voice. Even the major clapped
Bul Run on the shoulder and said the sentiment
did him credit, however big the mortgage might
be.</p>
<p class="pnext">By the time Castro brought in his first surprise—a
delicious soup—a jovial and friendly party
was gathered around the oilcloth board. Even
the paper napkins could not dampen the joy of
the occasion, or detract from the exquisite flavor
of the broth.</p>
<p class="pnext">The boyish Dolph bewailed anon the absence
of his “Nell,” who loved Castro’s cookery above
everything else, while every endeavor of Mr.
Runyon to explain the self-starter on his new car
was so adroitly headed off by his fellow ranchers
that the poor fellow was in despair. The “lunch”
turned out to be a seven course dinner and each
course introduced such an enticing and unusual
dish that every member of the party became an
audacious gormandizer. None of the girls—except
Louise—had ever tasted such concoctions
before, or might even guess what many of them
were composed of; but all agreed with Patsy when
she energetically asserted that “Castro out-cheffed
both Rector and Sherry.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“If only he would have tablecloths and napkins,
and decent rugs upon the floor,” added
dainty Louise.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, that would ruin the charm of the place,”
protested Uncle John. “Don’t suggest such a
horror to Castro, Louise; at least until after we
have returned to New York.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’ll take you riding in my car,” piped Runyon
to Beth, who sat beside him. “I don’t have to
crank it, you know; I just—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Have you sold your orange crop yet?” asked
Arthur.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Lemons, sir!” said the other reproachfully.
And the laugh that followed again prevented his
explaining the self-starter.</p>
<p class="pnext">The porch was shady and cool when they
emerged from the feast room and Arthur Weldon,
as host, proposed they sit on the benches with
their coffee and cigars and have a social chat. But
both Runyon and Hahn protested this delay.
They suggested, instead, that all ride back to El
Cajon and play with the baby, and so earnest
were they in this desire that the proud young
father and mother had not the grace to refuse.</p>
<p class="pnext">Both men had their cars at the village garage
and an hour later the procession started. Beth
riding beside “Bul Run” and Patsy accompanying
the jolly “Dolph.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“We must stop and pick up Nell,” said the
latter, “for she’d be mad as hops if I went to see
Toodlums without her.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I don’t wonder,” replied Patsy. “Isn’t my
niece a dear baby?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Never was one born like her. She’s the only
woman I ever knew who refuses to talk.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“She crows, though.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“To signify she agrees with everyone on every
question; and her angelic smile is so genuine and
constant that it gets to your heart in spite of all
resistance.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“And she’s so soft and mushy, as it were,”
continued Patsy enthusiastically; “but I suppose
she’ll outgrow that, in time.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Mrs. Helen Hahn, when the three automobiles
drew up before her young husband’s handsome
residence, promptly agreed to join Rudolph in
a visit to the baby. She proved to be a retiring
and rather shy young woman, but she was very
beautiful and her personality was most attractive.
Both Patsy and Beth were delighted to find
that Louise had so charming a neighbor, of nearly
her own age.</p>
<p class="pnext">Rudolph would not permit the party to proceed further
until all had partaken of a refreshing
glass of lemonade, and as this entailed more
or less delay the sun was getting low as they
traversed the five miles to El Cajon, traveling
slowly that they might enjoy the exquisite tintings
of the sky. Runyon, who was a bachelor,
lived a few miles the other side of Arthur’s ranch.
All three ranches had at one time been part of the
Spanish grant to the Cristovals, and while Arthur
now possessed the old mansion, the greatest number
of acres had been acquired by Rudolph Hahn,
who had preferred to build for himself and his
bride a more modern residence.</p>
</div>
<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-viigone">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id8">CHAPTER VII—GONE!</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">The Weldons and their guests were greeted at
their door by a maid, for there were no men
among the house servants, and as Louise ushered
the party into the living room she said to the girl:</p>
<p class="pnext">“Ask Miss Travers to bring the baby here.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The maid departed and was gone so long that
Louise started out to see why her order was not
obeyed. She met the woman coming back with a
puzzled face.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Mees Traver not here, señora,” she said.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Then tell Inez to fetch the baby.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Inez not here, señora,” returned the woman.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Indeed! Then where is baby?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Mees Jane not here, señora.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Louise rushed to the nursery, followed by
Arthur, whose quick ears had overheard the
statement. The young mother bent over the crib,
the covers of which were thrown back as if the
infant had been quickly caught up—perhaps
from a sound sleep.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Good gracious!” cried Louise, despairingly;
“she’s gone—my baby’s gone!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Gone?” echoed Arthur, in a distracted tone.
“What does it mean, Louise? Where can she
be?”</p>
<p class="pnext">A gentle hand was laid on his shoulder and
Uncle John, who had followed them to the room,
said soothingly:</p>
<p class="pnext">“Don’t get excited, my boy; there’s nothing to
worry about. Your two nurses have probably
taken little Jane out for a ride.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“At this time of night?” exclaimed Louise.
“Impossible!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“It is merely twilight; they may have been delayed,”
replied Mr. Merrick.</p>
<p class="pnext">“But the air grows chill at this hour, and—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“And there is the baby-cab!” added Arthur,
pointing to a corner.</p>
<p class="pnext">Louise and her husband looked into one another’s eyes
and their faces grew rigid and white.
Uncle John, noting their terror, spoke again.</p>
<p class="pnext">“This is absurd,” said he. “Two competent
nurses, both devoted to little Jane, would not
allow the baby to come to harm, I assure you.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Where is she, then?” demanded Arthur.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Hello; what’s up?” called Patsy Doyle, entering
the room with Beth to see what was keeping
them from their guests.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Baby’s gone!” wailed Louise, falling into a
chair promptly to indulge in a flood of tears.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Gone? Nonsense,” said Beth, gazing into the
empty cradle. Then she put down her hand and
felt of the bedding. It had no warmth. Evidently
the child had been removed long ago.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Before we give way to hysterics,” advised
Uncle John, striving to appear calm, “let us investigate
this matter sensibly. Babies don’t disappear
mysteriously, in these days, I assure you.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Question the servants,” suggested Patsy.</p>
<p class="pnext">“That’s the idea,” squeaked a high tenor voice,
and there in the dim light stood big Bulwer Runyon,
and with him little Rudolph and his wife
Helen, all exhibiting astonished and disturbed
countenances.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I—I can’t see any reason for worry, Louise,
dear,” remarked Mrs. Hahn, in a voice that
trembled with agitation. “Not a soul on earth
would harm that precious Jane.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Arthur turned to the maid.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Send all the servants here,” he commanded.
“Every one of them, mind you!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Presently they congregated in the roomy nursery,
which had now been brilliantly lighted.
There were five women—some old and some
young, but all Mexicans—and a little withered
Chinaman named Sing Fing, whose age was uncertain
and whose yellow face seemed incapable
of expression.</p>
<p class="pnext">Uncle John, assisted at times by Rudolph and
Arthur, did the questioning. Marcia had seen
Miss Travers leave the house, alone, at about two
o’clock, as if for a walk. She did not notice
which way the nurse went nor whether she returned.
Perhaps she wore a cloak; Marcia could
not tell. The day was warm; doubtless Miss
Travers had no wraps at all. A hat? Oh, no.
She would have noticed a hat.</p>
<p class="pnext">The only one who recollected seeing Inez was
Eulalia, a chambermaid. She had observed Inez
sitting in the court, in a despondent attitude, at
about half past two. Yes; it might have been
a little earlier; it was hard to remember. None
of the house servants paid much attention to the
nurses. They had their own duties to perform.</p>
<p class="pnext">But the baby had not been seen at all; not since
Inez had brought her in from her ride at noon.
Then it was Miss Travers who had taken the
child from the cab and with her disappeared into
the nursery.</p>
<p class="pnext">This report did not prove reassuring. Sing
Fing announced that Miss Travers had prepared
the baby’s liquid food in the kitchen at half past
twelve, but that neither she nor Inez had joined
the other servants at luncheon. This last was not
an unusual occurrence, it seemed, but taken in
connection with the other circumstances it impressed
the questioners as suspicious.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Perhaps they are all at the Mexican quarters,”
exclaimed Patsy, with sudden inspiration.</p>
<p class="pnext">Arthur and Rudolph immediately volunteered
to investigate the quarters and started off on a
run.</p>
<p class="pnext">“It’s all right, you know,” consolingly panted
Dolph, on the way. “The baby and her nurses
can’t be lost, strayed or stolen, so don’t worry.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Common sense urges me to agree with you,”
returned Arthur, “but there’s certainly something
mysterious about the disappearance.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“It won’t be mysterious when we discover the
reason, you know.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The men were all at work in the olive groves,
but some of the women were in the huts and old
Bella listened to Arthur’s frantic questions with
blank amazement, as did the others who hastily
congregated.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Thees morn,” said Bella, “Inez bring Mees
Jane here for little time—not long time. Then
she takes her ’way again.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“While Inez here,” said another woman, “I
see that other—the American nurse—behind
hedge, yonder, watching us.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“How you know that?” demanded Bella
sharply, as she turned to the speaker.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I know because she is stranger,” was the calm
reply. “Inez see her, too, an’ that ees why Inez
hurry away.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Which way did she go?” asked Arthur, and
they all pointed to the path that led to the house.</p>
<p class="pnext">“It doesn’t matter,” suggested Dolph. “We
know that both the nurses were in the house afterward.
The main point is that the baby is not
here.”</p>
<p class="pnext">As they started to return they came face to face
with old Miguel. The shadow was deep beneath
the trees but there was no mistaking the Mexican’s
snow-white hair.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Have you seen baby?” demanded Weldon
eagerly.</p>
<p class="pnext">Miguel stared at them. He came nearer, putting
his face close to his master’s, and stared
harder.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Mees Jane? You ask for Mees Jane?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes. Tell me, quick, do you know where she
is?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Mees Jane mus’ be at house,” said Miguel,
passing a hand over his eyes as if bewildered.</p>
<p class="pnext">“She is not,” said Rudolph. “She is gone, and
both her nurses are gone.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Inez gone?” repeated the old man, stupidly.
“Ah; then she have carried away Mees Jane! I
was ’fraid of that.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Carried her away! Why should she do
that?” asked Arthur impatiently.</p>
<p class="pnext">“She jealous of New York girl—Mees Travers.
Inez say she kill Mees Travers; but I tell her
no. I say better not. But Inez hate thees girl
for taking Mees Jane away from her. Inez love
baby, Meest Weld; too much to be safe nurse.”</p>
<p class="pnext">While Arthur tried to comprehend this strange
information Rudolph said to Miguel:</p>
<p class="pnext">“Then you haven’t seen the baby? You don’t
know where she is?”</p>
<p class="pnext">The old Mexican gave him a keen look.</p>
<p class="pnext">“No, Meest Hahn.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You don’t know where Inez has gone?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“No, Meest Hahn.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Nor the other nurse—the American girl?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“No, Meest Hahn.”</p>
<p class="pnext">They hurried back to the house, leaving the old
Mexican standing motionless beside the path.</p>

<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id9">CHAPTER VIII—VERY MYSTERIOUS</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">Arthur found Louise developing hysteria, while
Beth, Patsy and Helen Hahn were working over
her and striving to comfort her. Uncle John, the
major and big Runyon stood gazing helplessly
at the dolorous scene.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well? Well?” cried Mr. Merrick, as Weldon
and young Hahn entered. “Any news?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Arthur shook his head and went to his wife,
bending over to kiss her forehead.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Be brave, dear!” he whispered.</p>
<p class="pnext">It needed but this tender admonition to send
the young mother into new paroxysms.</p>
<p class="pnext">“See here; we’re wasting time,” protested
Runyon, his voice reaching high C in his excitement.
“Something must be done!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Of course,” cried Patsy, turning from Louise.
“We’re a lot of ninnies. Let us think what is
best to do and map out a logical program.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The others looked at her appealingly, glad to
have some one assume command but feeling themselves
personally unequal to the task of thinking
logically.</p>
<p class="pnext">“First,” said the girl, firmly, “let us face the
facts. Baby Jane has mysteriously disappeared,
and with her the two nurses.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Not necessarily with her,” objected Rudolph.
“Let us say the two nurses have also disappeared.
Now, the question is, why?”</p>
<p class="pnext">A shriek from Louise emphasised the query.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Don’t let’s bother with the ‘why?’” retorted
Patsy. “We don’t care why. The vital question
is ‘where?’ All we want, just now, is to find
baby and get her back home again to her loving
friends. She can’t have been gone more than four
hours—or five, at the most. Therefore she isn’t
so far away that an automobile can’t overtake
her.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But she can’t walk, you know,” squeaked
Runyon. “Baby didn’t go alone; some one took
her.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“True enough,” observed Uncle John.
“You’re wrong, Patsy. We must try to decide
who took baby, and why. Then we might undertake
the search with a chance of success.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Whoever took baby went on foot,” persisted
Miss Doyle. “The only four automobiles in the
neighborhood are now standing in our driveway
and in the garage. This is a country of great distances,
and no matter in what direction the baby
has been taken an auto is sure to overhaul her,
if we don’t waste valuable time in getting
started.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“That’s right!” cried Arthur, turning from
Louise. “The theory agrees with old Miguel’s
suspicion about Inez, and—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What suspicion?” cried half a dozen.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Never mind that,” said Rudolph, with a hasty
glance toward Louise; “let’s be off, and talk
afterward.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“We men must decide on our routes and all
take the road at once,” proposed Rudolph.</p>
<p class="pnext">“It’s pitch dark,” said Runyon.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Would you like to wait until morning?” demanded
Rudolph, sarcastically.</p>
<p class="pnext">“No; I want to rescue that baby,” said the big
fellow.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Then take the north road, as far as Tungar’s
ranch. Stop at every house to inquire. When
you get to Tungar’s, come back by the McMillan
road. That’s a sixty mile jaunt, and it will cover
the north and northwest. Take Mr. Merrick
with you. Now, then, off you go!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Runyon nodded and left the room, followed
gladly by Uncle John, who longed to be doing
something that would count. The others soon
heard the roar of the motor car as it started away
on its quest.</p>
<p class="pnext">Then it was arranged for Arthur to drive back
to Escondido to make inquiries and to watch the
departure of the evening train, the only one to
pass the station since baby had been missing. He
was to carry Major Doyle with him and return
by another route. Hahn promised to cover with
his own car the only other two roads that remained
to be searched, and he figured that they
would all return to the house within two or three
hours, when—if still there was no news—they
might plan a further pursuit of the fugitive baby.</p>
<p class="pnext">Helen Hahn had promised not to leave Louise
until baby was found, and before starting Arthur
assisted his wife to her room, where he left her
weeping dismally one moment and screaming for
little Jane the next.</p>
<p class="pnext">Sing Fing had sent a maid to announce dinner,
but no one paid any attention to the summons.</p>
<p class="pnext">After the three automobiles had departed,
Patsy and Beth remained in the nursery and left
Helen and a maid with Louise. Once alone, Miss
Doyle said to her cousin:</p>
<p class="pnext">“Having started them upon the search, Beth,
you and I must take up that pertinent suggestion
made by Mr. Hahn and face the important question:
‘Why?’”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’m dying to be of some use, dear,” responded
Beth in a disconsolate tone, “but I fear we two
girls are quite helpless. How can <em class="italics">we</em> tell why the
baby has been stolen?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Has she been stolen?” inquired Patsy. “We
mustn’t take even that for granted. Let us be
sensible and try to marshal our wits. Here’s the
fact: baby’s gone. Here’s the problem: why?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“We don’t know,” said Beth. “No one
knows.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Of course some one knows. Little Jane, as
our friend Bul Run reminded us, can’t walk. If
she went away, she was carried. By whom?
And why? And where?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Dear me!” cried Beth, despairingly; “if we
knew all that, we could find baby.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Exactly. So let’s try to acquire the knowledge.”</p>
<p class="pnext">She went into Mildred’s room and made an
examination of its contents. The place seemed
in its usual order, but many of Mildred’s trinkets
and personal possessions were scattered
around.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Her absence wasn’t premeditated,” decided
Patsy. “Her white sweater is gone, but that is
all. This fact, however, may prove that she expected
to be out after dark. It is always chilly
in this country after sundown and doubtless
Mildred knew that.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Why, she used to live here!” cried Beth.
“Of course she knew.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Patsy sat down and looked at her cousin attentively.</p>
<p class="pnext">“That is news to me,” she said in a tone that
indicated she had made a discovery. “Do you
mean that Mildred once lived in this neighborhood?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes; very near here. She told me she had
known this old house well years ago, when she
was a girl. She used to visit it in company with
her father, a friend of old Señor Cristoval.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Huh!” exclaimed Patsy. “That’s queer,
Why didn’t she tell us this, when we first proposed
bringing her out here?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I don’t know. I remember she was overjoyed
when I first suggested her coming, but I
supposed that was because she had at last found
a paying job.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“When did she tell you of this?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Just lately.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What else did she say?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Nothing more. I asked if she had any relatives
or friends living here now, but she did not
reply.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Beth, I’m astonished!” asserted Patsy, with
a grave face. “This complicates matters.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I don’t see why.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Because, if Mildred knows this neighborhood,
and wanted to steal baby and secrete her,
she could take little Jane to her unknown friends
and we could never discover her hiding-place.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Why should Mildred Travers wish to steal
baby?” asked Beth.</p>
<p class="pnext">“For a reward—a ransom. She knows that
Arthur Weldon is rich, and that Uncle John is
richer, and she also knows that dear little Toodlums
is the pride of all our hearts. If she demands
a fortune for the return of baby, we will
pay it at once.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“And prosecute her abductor, Mildred, afterward,”
said Beth. “No, Patsy; I don’t believe
she’s that sort of a girl, at all.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“We know nothing of her history. She is
secretive and reserved. Mildred’s cold, hard eyes
condemn her as one liable to do anything. And
this was such an easy way for her to make a
fortune.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Beth was about to protest this severe judgment, but
on second thought remained silent.
Appearances were certainly against Mildred
Travers and Beth saw no reason to champion her,
although she confessed to herself that she had
liked the girl and been interested in helping her.</p>
<p class="pnext">“We have still Inez to consider,” said she.
“What has become of the Mexican girl?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“We are coming to her presently,” replied
Patsy. “Let us finish with Mildred first. A girl
who has evidently had a past, which she guards
jealously. A poor girl, whose profession scarcely
earned her bread-and-butter before we engaged
her. A girl whose eyes repel friendship; who
has little to lose by kidnapping Jane in the attempt
to secure a fortune. She was fond of
baby; I could see that myself; so she won’t injure
our darling but will take good care of her
until we pay the money, when Toodlums will be
restored to us, smiling and crowing as usual.
Beth, if this reasoning is correct, we needn’t
worry. By to-morrow morning Arthur will receive
the demand for ransom, and he will lose
no time in satisfying Mildred’s cupidity.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Very good reasoning,” said Beth; “but I
don’t believe a word of it.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I hope it is true,” said Patsy, “for otherwise
we are facing a still worse proposition.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Inez?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes. Inez isn’t clever; she doesn’t care for
money; she would not steal Jane for a ransom.
But the Mexican girl worships baby in every fibre
of her being. She would die for baby; she—”
lowering her voice to a whisper, “she would
<em class="italics">kill</em> anyone for baby.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Beth shivered involuntarily as Patsy uttered
this horrible assertion.</p>
<p class="pnext">“You mean—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Now, let us look at this matter calmly. Inez
has, from the first, resented the employment of
Mildred as chief nurse. She has hated Mildred
with a deadly hatred and brooded over her fancied
wrongs until she has lost all sense of reason.
She feared that in the end baby Jane would be
taken away from her, and this thought she could
not bear. Therefore she has stolen baby and carried
her away, so as to have the precious one
always in her keeping.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“And Mildred?” asked Beth.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well, in regard to Mildred, there are two
conjectures to consider. She may have discovered
that Inez had stolen baby and is now following
in pursuit. Or—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Or what, dear?” as imaginative Patsy hesitated,
appalled by her own mental suggestion.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Or in a fit of anger Inez murdered Mildred
and hid her body. Then, to escape the penalty
of her crime, she ran away and took baby with
her. Either one of these suppositions would account
for the absence of both nurses.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Beth looked at her cousin in amazement.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I think,” said she, “you’d better go and get
something to eat; or a cup of tea, at least. This
excitement is—is—making you daffy, Patsy
dear.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Pah! Food would disgust me. And I’m
not crazy, Beth. Dreadful things happen in this
world, at times, and Louise has a queer lot of
people around her. Think a moment. Our baby
has disappeared. Her two nurses, neither of
whom are especially trustworthy, have also disappeared.
There’s a reason, Beth, and you may
be sure it’s not any common, ordinary reason,
either. I’m trying to be logical in my deductions
and to face the facts sensibly.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Inez would be as careful of baby’s welfare
as would Mildred.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I realize that. If I thought for a moment
that baby was in any peril I would go distracted,
and scream louder than poor Louise is doing. Do
you hear her? Isn’t it awful?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Let us tell Louise these things,” said Beth,
rising from her chair. “What you call your
‘deductions’ are terribly tragic, Patsy, but they
reassure us about baby. Shall we go to Louise?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I think it will be better,” decided Patsy, and
they left the nursery and stepped out into the
court. At the far end of the open space stood
huddled a group of men, all of whom bore lanterns.
Patsy advanced to the group and discovered
them to be the Mexican laborers from
the quarters. Old Miguel advanced a pace and
bowed.</p>
<p class="pnext">“We search for baby—for Mees Jane—eh?”
he said, questioningly, as if desiring instructions.</p>
<p class="pnext">“That is a happy thought, Miguel,” replied the
girl. “The others are scouring the roads in their
motor cars, but the country needs searching, too—away
from the roads, in the fields and orchards.
Send your men out at once, and scatter
them in all directions.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Miguel turned and rapidly harangued his followers
in the Spanish patois. One by one they
turned and vanished into the night. Only the
old man remained.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Ever’bod’ love Mees Jane,” he said simply.
“They all want to find her, an’ ask me to let ’em
go. Good. They will search well.”</p>
<p class="pnext">In spite of the words there was a tone of indifference
in Miguel’s voice that attracted the
girl’s notice. He did not seem in the least worried
or agitated, nor did he appear to attach much
importance to the search. Yet Patsy knew the
aged foreman was one of “Mees Jane’s” most
devoted admirers.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Where do you think baby is?” she asked
abruptly.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Quien sabe?” he answered, and then in
English, “who knows?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Be sensible, Miguel! No one would hurt
the dear child, I’m sure.”</p>
<p class="pnext">His dark features wrinkled in an engaging
smile.</p>
<p class="pnext">“No one would hurt Mees Jane. I believe it.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But some one has carried her away.”</p>
<p class="pnext">He shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Some time she come back,” said he.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Now, see here, Miguel; you know more than
anyone else about this affair. Tell me the truth.”</p>
<p class="pnext">He raised his brows, shaking his head.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I know nothing,” said he. “I not worry
much; but I know nothing.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Then you suspect.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The old man regarded her curiously; almost
suspiciously, Patsy thought.</p>
<p class="pnext">“What ees suspec’?” he asked. “It ees nothing.
To suspec’ ees not to know. Not to know
ees—nothing at all.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The girl stamped her foot impatiently, for she
caught Beth smiling at her.</p>
<p class="pnext">“What is Inez to you, Miguel?” she demanded.</p>
<p class="pnext">Again he smiled the childlike, engaging smile.</p>
<p class="pnext">“She ees to me nothing,” said he. “Inez is
Mexican, but her family ees not my family. Not
all Mexicans ees—re—spec’—ble. Once I
know Inez’ father. He drink too much wheesky,
an’ the wheesky make heem bad.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But you like Inez?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“She ees good to Mees Jane; but—she have
bad tempers.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Patsy thought a moment.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Did you know Mildred Travers when she
used to live near here?” she asked.</p>
<p class="pnext">Old Miguel started and took a step forward.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Where she leeve, when she ees here?” he
asked eagerly.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I don’t know. Have you ever seen her?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“No. She do not come to our quarters.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Wait a minute,” said Patsy, and ran up to
her room, leaving Beth to confront the ranchero
and to study him with her dark, clear eyes. But
she said nothing until her cousin returned and
thrust a small kodak print into Miguel’s hand.</p>
<p class="pnext">“That is Mildred Travers,” said Patsy.</p>
<p class="pnext">Miguel held up his lantern while he examined
the picture and both girls observed that his hand
trembled. For a long time he remained bent over
the print—an unnecessarily long time, indeed—but
when he raised his head his face was impassive
as a mask.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I do not know Mees Travers,” was all he
said as he handed back the picture. “Now I go
an’ hunt for Mees Jane,” he quickly added.</p>
<p class="pnext">They watched him turn and noticed that his
steps, as he left the court, were tottering and
feeble.</p>
<p class="pnext">“He lied,” said Beth, softly.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I am sure of it,” agreed Patsy; “but that
does not enlighten the mystery any. I’m sorry
we brought Mildred to this place. There’s just
one thing you can bank on, Beth: that in some
way or other Mildred is responsible for the disappearance
of our precious Toodlums.”</p>

<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id10">CHAPTER IX—A FRUITLESS SEARCH</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">Meantime, Uncle John and big Runyon were
bowling along the north road, the lights gleaming
from the powerful lanterns of the car and
illuminating every object on either side of the
way. The road seemed deserted and it was fully
twenty minutes before they came to the first
ranch house beyond that owned by Runyon himself.
Here Mr. Merrick got out to make inquiries.</p>
<p class="pnext">A tall, slovenly dressed woman answered his
ring. She carried an oil lamp in her hand and
eyed her late visitor severely.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Have you seen a woman with a baby pass
this way to-day—this afternoon?” asked the
little man.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes,” was the reply; “she stopped here for
supper.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Uncle John’s heart gave a great bound.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Have they gone on?” he inquired.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes; an hour ago.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Which way, ma’am?”</p>
<p class="pnext">She nodded toward the north and Mr. Merrick
hastily turned away. Then, pausing as a
thought occurred to him, he asked:</p>
<p class="pnext">“Was the—the baby—quite well, ma’am?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Seemed so,” was the gruff answer and she
slammed the door.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Of course she was provoked,” mused Uncle
John, as he hurried back to the car. “I forgot
to thank her. Never mind; we’ll stop on our
way back.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well?” demanded Runyon.</p>
<p class="pnext">“We’ve got ’em!” was the joyful response.
“They stopped here for supper and went on an
hour ago. Drive ahead, and keep a sharp lookout.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Who stopped here?” asked the other, as he
started the car.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Why the woman with the baby, of course.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Which woman?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Which one? Oh, I didn’t bother to ask. It
doesn’t matter, does it, whether it’s Mildred or
Inez. It’s the baby we want.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Runyon drove on a while in silence.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Did she describe little Jane accurately?” he
asked, in his high, piping tenor.</p>
<p class="pnext">“She didn’t describe her at all,” said Uncle
John, provoked by such insistence. “There isn’t
likely to be more than one baby missing, in this
lonely section of the country.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The big rancher made no reply. Both were
keenly eyeing every object that fell under the
light of the lamps. Presently they caught sight
of a small white house half hidden by a grove
of tall eucalyptus. There was no driveway, but
the car was stopped at the nearest point and
Uncle John got out. To his surprise Runyon followed
him, saying:</p>
<p class="pnext">“Two heads are better than one, sir.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What do you mean by that, sir?” asked Mr.
Merrick, sternly. “Don’t you think I’m competent
to ask a question?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You don’t ask enough questions,” returned
Runyon frankly. “I’m not sure we’re on the
right trail.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well, I am,” declared Uncle John, stiffly.</p>
<p class="pnext">It took then some time to arouse the inhabitants
of the house, who seemed to have retired for
the night, although it was still early. Finally a
woman thrust her head from an upper window.</p>
<p class="pnext">“What’s wanted?” she inquired in querulous
tones.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Have you seen a woman with a baby pass
by here?” called Uncle John.</p>
<p class="pnext">“No.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Thank you, ma’am; sorry to have troubled
you,” said the little man, but in a very disappointed
voice.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Hold on a minute!” cried Runyon, as the
woman was closing the window. “They told us
at the last house that a woman with a baby
stopped there for supper.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh; they did, eh?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes; and she came in this direction; so we
thought you might have seen her.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well, I might, if I’d looked in the glass,”
she said with grim humor. “I’m the woman.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, indeed!” cried Uncle John, feeling bewildered.
“And the baby?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Safe asleep, if your yellin’ don’t wake him.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Then—it’s—<em class="italics">your</em> baby!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’ll swear to that. What do you want, anyhow?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“We’re looking for a lost baby,” piped Bul
Run.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Then you’ll hev to look somewhere else. I’ve
walked all the way to town, an’ back to-day, an’
I’m dead tired. Are you goin’ away, or not?”</p>
<p class="pnext">They went away. Neither spoke as they again
entered the car and started it upon the quest.
Five minutes passed; ten; fifteen. Then Mr.
Runyon said in a higher key than usual:</p>
<p class="pnext">“There’s nothing on a car as handy as a self-starter.
All you have to do is—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, shut up!” growled Uncle John.</p>
<p class="pnext">They drove more slowly, after this, and maintained
a sharp watch; but both men had abandoned
all hope of discovering the missing baby
on this route. When they reached Tungar’s
Ranch they crossed over to a less frequented road
known as McMillan’s which would lead them
back to El Cajon, but by a roundabout, devious
route.</p>
<p class="pnext">The nearer they drew to the ranch the greater
vigilance they displayed, but the road was deserted
and no one at any of the ranch houses had
seen or heard anything of a stray baby. As they
turned into Arthur’s driveway they overtook
Rudolph Hahn, just returning from a quest as
fruitless as their own. It was now half past nine
o’clock.</p>
<p class="pnext">Arthur Weldon and Major Doyle had both
realized that the route awarded them was the
most promising of all. It was scarcely conceivable
that anyone who had stolen baby Jane would
carry her farther into the unsettled districts. Far
more likely that Toodlums’ abductor would make
for the nearest town or the railway station.</p>
<p class="pnext">“If we know which one of the girls had taken
baby,” said Arthur, “we could figure better on
what she would likely do. Inez would try to
reach some Mexican settlement where she had
friends, while Mildred might attempt to get into
Los Angeles or San Diego, where she could safely
hide.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I can’t believe either of them would steal
little Jane,” declared the major. “They are too
fond of her for that.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But the baby has been stolen, nevertheless,”
returned Arthur; “we can’t get around that fact.
And one of the nurses did it”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Why?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Because the nurses disappeared with the
baby.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Then perhaps they’ve entered into a conspiracy,
and both are equally guilty in the abduction,”
suggested the major.</p>
<p class="pnext">“No; their hatred of one another would prevent
any conspiracy between them. Only one
stole the baby away, I’m quite sure.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Then where’s the other nurse?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Arthur made no reply, but the major expected
none. It was one of those mysteries that baffle
the imagination. By and by Major Doyle made
an attempt to answer his question himself, unconsciously
using the same argument that his
daughter Patsy had during her conversation with
Beth.</p>
<p class="pnext">“For the sake of argument, and to try to get
somewhere near the truth,” said he, “let us concede
that, after we had gone to town, the two
nurses quarreled. That would not be surprising;
I’ve been expecting an open rupture between
them. Following the quarrel, what happened?
In view of the results, as we find them, two deductions
are open to us. One girl may have made
away with the other, in a fit of unreasoning rage,
and then taken baby and run away to escape the
consequences of her crime. If that conclusion is
true, Inez is the more likely to be the criminal
and it is Mildred’s dead body we shall find in a
clump of bushes or hidden in the cellar. That
Mexican girl has a fierce temper; I’ve seen her
eyes gleam like those of a wildcat as she watched
Mildred kiss and cuddle little Jane. And she was
so madly devoted to baby that she’d sooner die
than part with her. Mildred is different; she’s
more civilized.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“To me, her eyes seem more treacherous than
those of Inez,” declared Arthur, who had liked
the little Mexican nurse because she had been so
fond of Toodlums. “They never meet your gaze
frankly, those eyes, but seem always trying to
cover some dark secret of which the girl is
ashamed.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Nevertheless, I maintain that she is the more
civilized of the two,” insisted the major. “She
has a calmer, more deliberate nature. She
wouldn’t be likely to hurt Inez, while Inez would
enjoy murdering Mildred.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What’s the other hypothesis?” asked
Arthur.</p>
<p class="pnext">“The more sensible one, by odds. After the
quarrel, Inez grabs up baby and runs away, determined
to escape from her hated rival and carry
Jane beyond her influence. Soon after, Mildred
discovers the flight of the Mexican and, impelled
by her duty to you and her desire to circumvent
Inez, rushes away in full chase, forgetting to
leave any word. Perhaps she thought she would
be able to return with baby before we arrived
back from town; but Inez has led her a merry
chase, which Mildred stubbornly refuses to
abandon. I’m an old man, Arthur, and have
seen a good deal of life, so mark my words:
when the truth of this affair is known, it will
be something like the story I’ve just outlined. I
believe I’ve hit the nail on the head, and I’ll
admit it’s bad enough, even that way.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Then,” said Arthur, more hopefully, “we
may find Mildred and baby at home, when we
return.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes; and we may not. If they are home,
Arthur, there are plenty there to look after the
wee darling, and Louise will be comforted. On
the other hand, if they don’t return, it must be
our business to find them. I can imagine Mildred,
fagged out, in some far-away corner, resolving
to stay the night and return to the ranch
in the morning.”</p>
<p class="pnext">They remembered to have passed along this
road before, that afternoon, on their way home
from town. At that time they had seen no sign
of the nurses or the baby. But to make assurance
doubly sure Arthur stopped at every house
to make inquiries and the road was inspected
carefully. When they reached town they first
visited the local police station and then the telephone
office. Here they arranged to have every
ranch house within a wide radius called and questioned
in regard to the missing baby. Arthur
also tried to get his own house, but the wire was
still out of service.</p>
<p class="pnext">Then to the telegraph office, where messages
were sent to all the neighboring towns, giving
descriptions of the missing baby and the nurses
and offering a liberal reward for any news of
their whereabouts.</p>
<p class="pnext">By this time it was necessary to go to the depot,
as the evening train was soon due. While they
awaited its arrival Arthur and the major closely
scanned every member of the group gathered at
the station. Weldon even managed to have the
train held, on its arrival, until he had passed
through all the cars and assured himself that
neither Mildred, Inez or baby Jane was aboard.</p>
<p class="pnext">That automobile would have carried two despairing
men away from the little town had it not
been for the ray of hope suggested by the major
that they would find baby safe at home on their
arrival. However, that no chance might be neglected,
they took another route, as originally
arranged, and patiently continued their vain inquiries
all the way back to the ranch. As they
entered the driveway at El Cajon the clock in
the brilliantly lighted hall of the mansion was
striking ten.</p>
<p class="pnext">Arthur rushed in and was met by Patsy.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Any news?” they both cried eagerly; and
then their expectant faces fell.</p>
<p class="pnext">“How is Louise?” faltered Arthur.</p>
<p class="pnext">“More quiet, now,” answered the girl. “She
became so violent, after you left, that we were
all frightened; so Mrs. Hahn jumped into your
little car and drove home, where she telephoned
for the doctor. He happened to be at the Wilson
place, so she caught him there and he came directly
here. He is upstairs yet, but he gave
Louise a quieting potion and I think she is now
asleep.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Arthur started to mount the stairs; then hesitated.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Are the boys back yet?” he asked.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes; they are now out in the grounds, helping
the Mexicans search the shrubbery.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The young man shuddered.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I—I think I’ll join them,” he decided, and
the major merely gave his daughter a solemn kiss
and followed the bereaved father.</p>
<p class="pnext">At the back of the mansion the lights of the
lanterns were twinkling like fireflies, although the
stars shone so brilliantly that all near-by objects
were easily distinguished. Arthur and the major
joined the men and for two hours longer the
search was continued—more because they all
felt they must be doing something, than through
any hope of success.</p>
<p class="pnext">Finally, at midnight, the chief searchers met in
a group near the house, and Rudolph said: “Let’s
go in and rest a bit, and have a smoke. I’m about
fagged out and, as a matter of fact, we’ve
covered every inch of these grounds several times
over.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Arthur silently turned and led the way into the
house, where Patsy, Beth and Helen Hahn, all
three worn and haggard, met them in the hall.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Louise?” asked Arthur.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Sleeping quietly,” replied Beth. “Marcia is
sitting beside her.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Has Dr. Knox gone?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“No; he’s in the library, smoking. Eulalia is
getting him something to eat, for it seems he
missed his dinner.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Why, so did I!” trilled big Runyon, in his
clearest tenor. “I’ve just remembered it.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You must all eat something,” declared Patsy,
“else you won’t be fit to continue the search. Go
to the library—all of you—and Beth and I will
see what we can find in the kitchen.”</p>
</div>
<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-xconjectures-and-absurdities">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id11">CHAPTER X—CONJECTURES AND ABSURDITIES</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">In somber procession the men trailed up the
stairs to the big library, where a dapper little man
sat reading a book and puffing at a huge cigar.
He looked up, as they entered, and nodded a head
as guiltless of hair as was that of Uncle John.
But his face was fresh and chubby, despite his
fifty years, and the merry twinkle in his gray
eyes seemed out of place, at first thought, in this
house of anxiety and distress.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Ah, Weldon; what news of little Jane?” he
cheerfully inquired.</p>
<p class="pnext">“None, Doctor.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“No trace at all?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“None, whatever.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“That’s good,” declared the doctor, removing
the ash from his cigar.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Good!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Of course. No news is good news. I’ll
wager my new touring-car that our Jane is sound
asleep and dreaming of the angels, this very minute.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Has your new car a self-starter?” inquired
Runyon anxiously, as if about to accept the
wager.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I wish I might share your belief, Doctor,”
said Arthur with a deep sigh. “It all seems a
terrible mystery and I can think of no logical explanation
to assure me of baby’s safety.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes, it’s a mystery,” agreed Dr. Knox. “But
I’ve just thought of a solution.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What is it?” cried half a dozen voices.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Sit down and light up. I hope you all smoke?
And you need refreshment, for you’ve been working
under a strain.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Refreshments are coming presently,” said
Rudolph. “What’s your solution, Doc?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“The young ladies have been telling me every
detail of the disappearance, as well as the events
leading up to it. Now, it seems Mildred Travers
is an old resident of this section of California.
Was born here, in fact.”</p>
<p class="pnext">This was news to them all and the suggestion
it conveyed caused them to regard Dr. Knox
attentively.</p>
<p class="pnext">“The old Travers Ranch is near San Feliz—about
thirty miles south of here. I know that
ranch by reputation, but I’ve never been there.
Now for my solution. The Travers family, hearing
that Mildred is at El Cajon, drive over here
in their automobile and induce the girl to go
home with them. She can’t leave baby, so she
takes little Jane along, and also Inez to help care
for her. There’s the fact, in a nutshell. See?
It’s all as plain as a pikestaff.”</p>
<p class="pnext">For a moment there was silence. Then big
Runyon voiced the sentiment of the party in his
high treble.</p>
<p class="pnext">“You may be a good doctor,” said he, “but
you’re a thunderin’ bad detective.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“If I could telephone to the Travers Ranch,
I’d convince you,” asserted the doctor, unmoved
by adverse criticism; “but your blamed
old telephone is out of order.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“As for that,” remarked Rudolph, taking a
cigar from a box, “I’ve been a visitor at the
Travers Ranch many times. Charlie Benton lives
there. There hasn’t been a Travers on the place
since they sold it, ten or twelve years ago.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well,” said the doctor, “I’m sorry to hear
that. It was such a simple solution that I
thought it must be right.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“It was, indeed, simple,” admitted Runyon.
“Ah! here comes food at last.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Patsy, Beth and Helen bore huge trays containing
the principal dishes of the untasted dinner,
supplemented with sandwiches and steaming
coffee. This last the thoughtful Sing Fing had
kept in readiness all the evening, knowing it
would be required sooner or later.</p>
<p class="pnext">Neither Uncle John nor the major was loth
to partake of the much-needed refreshment.
They even persuaded Arthur to take a cup of
coffee. It was noticeable that now, whenever
baby Jane was mentioned, they spoke her name
in hushed whispers; yet no one could get away,
for long, from the one enthralling subject of the
little one’s mysterious disappearance.</p>
<p class="pnext">“What can we do now?” asked Arthur pleadingly.
“I feel guilty to be sitting here in comfort
while my darling may be suffering privations,
or—or—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Really, there is nothing more to be done,
just now,” said Patsy, interrupting him before
he could mention any other harrowing fears.
“You have all done everything that mortals could
do, for to-night, and in the morning we will resume
the search along other lines. In my opinion
you all ought to get to bed and try to rest,
for to-morrow there will be a lot for you to do.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What?” asked Arthur helplessly.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well, I think you ought to telegraph for detectives.
If ever a mystery existed, here is one,
and only a clever detective could know how to
tackle such a problem.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Also,” added Beth, “you ought to telegraph
to every place in California, ordering the arrest
of the fugitives.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’ve done that already.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Can’t anyone think of a <em class="italics">reason</em> for the disappearance
of these three persons—the baby and
her two nurses?” inquired Mrs. Hahn earnestly.
“It seems to me that if we knew what object
they could have in disappearing, we would be able
to guess where they’ve gone.” Then the pretty
little woman blushed at her temerity in making
such a long speech. But the doctor supported
her.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Now that,” said he, “strikes me as a sensible
proposition. Give us the reason, some of you
who know.”</p>
<p class="pnext">But no one knew a reason.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Here are some facts, though,” said Patsy.
“Inez was baby’s first nurse, and resented Mildred’s
coming. Somehow, I always get back to
that fact when I begin to conjecture. The two
nurses hated each other—everybody admits that.
Mildred hated mildly; Inez venomously.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Miguel told me that Inez has threatened to
kill Mildred,” said Arthur. “And there is another
thing: one of the women said Inez brought
the baby to the quarters, at about noon, and while
there they discovered Mildred watching them
from the shelter of a hedge. This incensed Inez
and she hurried away to the house, followed
stealthily by Mildred.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“That,” said Dolph, “was perhaps the beginning
of the quarrel. We don’t know what happened
afterward, except that both were seen in
the court with baby at about two o’clock.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Afterward,” said Patsy, “one of the housemaids
saw Inez go out—as if for a walk. She
may have returned. I think she did, for otherwise
it was Mildred who carried the baby away.
I can see no reason for her doing that.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Of course Inez returned,” declared Arthur,
“for nothing would induce her to run away from
us and leave her beloved baby. I believe the poor
girl would rather die than be separated for good
from little Jane. You’ve no idea how passionately
she worshiped the child.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“All of which,” the doctor stated, “indicates
a tragedy rather than some feminine whim—which
last I much prefer as a solution. But if
both nurses were fond of little Jane—who is the
finest baby I ever knew, by the way—no quarrel
or other escapade would permit them to injure
the dear infant. Let us worry about the two
girls, but not about little Jane.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Such advice was impossible to follow, and
doubtless the shrewd doctor knew it; but it was
a comforting thought, nevertheless, and had
already done much to sustain the despairing
father.</p>
<p class="pnext">No one seemed willing to adopt Patsy’s suggestion
that they go to bed and get some much
needed rest, in preparation for the morrow. Arthur
left them for a time to visit Louise, but soon
returned with word that she was quietly sleeping
under the influence of the potion the doctor had
administered. The three girls—for Mrs. Hahn
was only a girl—sat huddled in one corner,
whispering at times and trying to cheer one another.
The doctor read in his book. Rudolph
smoked and lay back in his chair, gazing reflectively
at the ceiling. Bul Run had his feet on a
second chair and soon fell into a doze, when he
snored in such a high falsetto that Arthur kicked
his shins to abate the nuisance. The major sat
stiffly, gazing straight ahead, and Uncle John
tramped up and down the room untiringly. The
baby had grown very dear to the hearts of these
last two men in the few days they had known her
and her sudden loss rendered them inconsolable.</p>
<p class="pnext">The suspense was dreadful. Had it been day,
they could have done something to further the
search, but the night held them impotent and they
knew they must wear out the dreary hours as
best they might.</p>
<p class="pnext">At one o’clock Patsy drew her father aside and
prevailed upon him to go to his room and lie
down.</p>
<p class="pnext">“This tedious waiting is merely wearing you
out,” she said, “and for dear baby’s sake you
should be fresh and vigorous in the morning.”</p>
<p class="pnext">That seemed to the major to be very sensible,
especially as he felt the need of rest, so he slipped
away and went to the blue room, which was
located in the old wing and just above the nursery.</p>
<p class="pnext">Then the girl approached Uncle John, but he
would not listen to her. He was too nervous to
rest, he insisted, and she realized that he spoke
truly. Just as she abandoned the argument they
were all startled by the sound of wheels rolling
up the driveway and Arthur rushed to an open
window and looked out.</p>
<p class="pnext">An automobile had just arrived.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Who is it?” he called.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Id’s me, Meisteh Veldon—id’s Peters, de
constable,” called a rich voice in strong German
dialect. “I got your baby here, und der Mexico
girls to boots!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What!” they all shrieked, springing up to
crowd around the window.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Bring her in, Peters!” yelled Arthur, a great
gladness in his voice, and now he was half running,
half tumbling down the stairs in his haste
to reach the door, while the others trailed after
him like the tail of a comet.</p>
<p class="pnext">As the door was thrown open Peters—a stout
German—entered with a bundle in his arms, followed
by a weeping, angry Mexican woman who
was fat and forty and as unlike Inez as was possible.</p>
<p class="pnext">Even as Arthur’s eyes fell on this poor creature
his heart sank, and the revulsion of feeling
was so severe that he tottered and almost fell.
Runyon grabbed his arm and supported him
while Peters fumbled with the wrappings of the
baby.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Do I gets me dot rewards—heh?” asked
the constable, holding up a fat little Mexican
baby, whose full black eyes regarded the group
wonderingly.</p>
<p class="pnext">The father turned away, heartsick.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Give him some money and get rid of him,”
he moaned.</p>
<p class="pnext">Dolph took the constable in hand.</p>
<p class="pnext">“You blooming idiot!” he exclaimed. “Why
did you drag that poor woman here?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Id iss a rewards for der Mexico girl unt a
baby; dot iss what ef’rybody say. How do I
know id iss not Herr Veldon’s baby?” demanded
the indignant German. “Do his baby gots a sign
on id, to say id iss de right baby, vot iss lost unt
must be foundt? No, py jimminy! He yust say
he hass a lost baby, unt a Mexico girl hass runned
avay mit id. * * * So I finds me a
Mexico girl unt a baby—unt here id iss!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Patsy took the baby, a good little thing, and
placed it in its mother’s arms.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Who are you, and where did this man find
you?” the girl asked sympathetically.</p>
<p class="pnext">The woman first shook her head and then burst
into a voluble stream of Spanish, not a word of
which could be understood.</p>
<p class="pnext">“She cannot speak de Ingliss, like me, so I
cannod tell if she iss de right Mexico vomans
or nod,” explained the constable. “Bud I brings
her mit me, yust de same, unt id costs me four
dollars to rendt me an automobubbles.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Take her back,” said Hahn, giving him a ten-dollar
note; and then he gave the woman some
money and kissed the baby, which smiled at him
approvingly.</p>
<p class="pnext">Beth ran to get some of the sandwiches for the
woman, while Patsy brought milk for the baby
and Uncle John offered the constable a cigar.
Then the three were sent away and the automobile
rolled back to town.</p>

<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id12">CHAPTER XI—THE MAJOR ENCOUNTERS THE GHOST</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">Ascending once more to the library the weary
watchers resumed their former attitudes of waiting,
as patiently as they might, for the coming of
the day. Uncle John looked at his watch and
found it was only a little after two o’clock. The
minutes seemed hours to-night.</p>
<p class="pnext">Suddenly a tremendous shriek rent the night,
a shriek so wild and blood-curdling in its intensity
that they sprang up and clung to each other
in horror. While they stood motionless and
terror-stricken there came a thump!—thump!—as
of some heavy object tumbling down the three
or four steps leading from the hall to the corridor
of the old South Wing, and then the door
burst open and Major Doyle—clothed in red-and-white
striped pajamas—fairly fell into the
library, rolled twice over and came to a stop in
a sitting position, from whence he let out another
yell that would have shamed a Cherokee Indian
and which so startled big Runyon that he held a
tenor note at high C for fully a minute—much
like the whistle of a peanut roaster—the which
was intended for an expression of unqualified
terror.</p>
<p class="pnext">Patsy was the first to recover and kneel beside
the poor major, whose eyes were literally bulging
from their sockets.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, Dad—dear Dad!—what is it?” she
cried.</p>
<p class="pnext">The major shuddered and clapped his hands
to his eyes. Then he rocked back and forth,
moaning dismally, while Patsy clung to his neck,
sobbing and nearly distracted.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Speak, Major!” commanded Arthur.</p>
<p class="pnext">“A—a ghost!” was the wailing reply.</p>
<p class="pnext">“A ghost!” echoed the amazed spectators.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Did you <em class="italics">see</em> it?” questioned Uncle John in
a trembling voice, as he bent over his brother-in-law.</p>
<p class="pnext">“See it?” shouted the major, removing his
hands to glare angrily at Mr. Merrick. “How
could I see anything in the dark? The room was
black as pitch.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But you said a ghost.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Of course I said a ghost,” retorted the major,
querulously, as he rubbed his bare ankle with
one hand to soothe a bump. “You don’t have
to <em class="italics">see</em> a ghost to know it’s there, do you? And
this ghost—Oh, Patsy, darling, I can’t say it!—it’s
too horrible.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Again a fit of shuddering seized him and he
covered his eyes anew and rocked his body back
and forth while he maintained his seat upon the
floor. His legs were spread wide apart and he
wiggled his big toes convulsively.</p>
<p class="pnext">Beth asked with bated breath:</p>
<p class="pnext">“Did you <em class="italics">hear</em> the ghost, then, Major?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Um! I heard it,” he moaned. “And it’s
the end of all—the destroyer of our hopes—the
harbinger of despair!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Look here, Major,” said Uncle John desperately,
“be a man, and tell us what you mean.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“It—it was baby—baby Jane!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Arthur sobbed and dropped his head upon the
table. Rudolph groaned. Runyon swore softly,
but with an accent that did not seem very wicked.
Uncle John stared hard at the major.</p>
<p class="pnext">“You’re an ass,” he said. “You’ve had a
nightmare.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The major could not bear such an aspersion,
even under the trying circumstances. He
scrambled to his feet, this time trembling with
indignant anger, and roared:</p>
<p class="pnext">“I tell you I heard baby—baby Jane—and
she was crying! Don’t I know? Don’t I know
our baby’s voice?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Arthur leaped to his feet, a resolute expression
upon his face. Instantly they all turned and followed
him from the room. Into the hall, up the
steps and through the corridor of the South
Wing they passed, and just inside the major’s
room Rudolph struck a match and lighted a lamp
that stood upon the table.</p>
<p class="pnext">The place was in wild disorder, for when the
major leaped from the bed he had dragged the
coverings with him and they lay scattered upon
the floor. The chair in which he had placed his
clothing had been overturned and there was no
question that his flight had been a precipitous
rout. The casement of the window, set far back
in the thick adobe wall, was wide open and the
night breeze that came through it made the flame
of the lamp flicker weirdly.</p>
<p class="pnext">Beth proved her courage by bolding crossing
the room and closing the window, while the
others stood huddled just inside the door. Back
of them all was the white face of Major Doyle,
a brave soldier who had faced the enemy unflinchingly
in many a hard fought battle, but a
veritable poltroon in an imaginary ghostly presence.</p>
<p class="pnext">Scarcely daring to breathe, they stood in tense
attitudes listening for a repetition of the baby’s
cry. Only an awesome, sustained silence rewarded
them.</p>
<p class="pnext">The major’s open watch upon the table ticked
out the minutes—five—ten—fifteen. Then
the doctor crept back to the library and quietly
resumed his book. Presently Runyon joined him.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Between you and me, Doc,” said the big fellow,
“I don’t take much stock in ghosts.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Nor I,” returned Dr. Knox. “Major Doyle
is overwrought. His imagination has played him
a trick.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Rudolph Hahn entered and lighted a fresh
cigar.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Curious thing, wasn’t it?” he said.</p>
<p class="pnext">“No; mere hallucination,” declared the doctor.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I don’t know about that,” answered the boy.
“Seems to me a ghost would do about as a person
in life did. The child cried—poor little
baby Jane!—and the ghostly wail was heard in
the one room in this house that is haunted—the
blue room. Perhaps there’s something about the
atmosphere of that room that enables those who
have passed over to make themselves heard by
us who are still in the flesh.”</p>
<p class="pnext">He was so earnest that the doctor glanced at
him thoughtfully over the top of his book.</p>
<p class="pnext">“It’s the dead of night, and you’re agitated
and unreasonable, Hahn. In the morning you’ll
be ashamed of your credulity.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Dolph sat down without reply. His wife came
in and sat beside him, taking his hand in hers.
In another quarter of an hour back came Uncle
John, shivering with the chill of the corridor,
and stood warming himself before the grate fire.</p>
<p class="pnext">“If the major heard the baby,” he said reflectively,
“it must be proof that—that something—has
happened to the little dear, and—and we
must face the worst.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well, it was baby I heard,” asserted the
major, who, having hastily donned his clothes,
now made his reappearance in the library. “I
was lying in a sort of dose when the cry first
reached my ears. Then I sat up and listened, and
heard it again distinctly, as if little Jane were
only two feet away. Then—then—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Then you tested your lungs and made your
escape,” added the doctor drily.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I admit it, sir!” said Major Doyle, haughtily.
“Had it been anyone else who encountered
the experience—even a pill peddler—he would
have fainted.”</p>
<p class="pnext">In the blue room Patsy and Beth alone remained
with Arthur Weldon. Not a sound broke
the stillness. When an hour had passed, Patsy
said:</p>
<p class="pnext">“Won’t you go away, Arthur? Beth and I
will watch.”</p>
<p class="pnext">He shook his head.</p>
<p class="pnext">“You can do no good by staying in this awful
place,” pleaded the girl, speaking in a whisper.</p>
<p class="pnext">“If she—if baby—should be heard again,
I—I’d like to be here,” he said pathetically.</p>
<p class="pnext">Patsy knew he was suffering and the fact
aroused her to action.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Father isn’t a coward,” she remarked, “and
either he heard the cry, or he dreamed it. In the
latter case it amounts to nothing; but if Jane
really cried out, that fact ought to give us an important
clue.”</p>
<p class="pnext">He started at this suggestion, which the girl
had uttered without thought, merely to reassure
him. Yet now she started herself, struck by the
peculiar significance of her random words.</p>
<p class="pnext">“In what way, Patsy?” asked Beth, calmly.</p>
<p class="pnext">That was the spur she needed. She glanced
around the room a moment and then asked:</p>
<p class="pnext">“Who built this wing, Arthur?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Cristoval, I suppose. I’ve heard it was the
original dwelling,” he replied. “The rest of the
house was built at a much later date. Perhaps
two generations labored in constructing the place.
I do not know; but it is not important.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, yes it is!” cried Patsy with increasing
ardor. “The rest of the house is like many other
houses, but—these walls are six or eight feet in
thickness.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Adobe,” said Arthur carelessly. “They built
strongly in the mission days.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yet these can’t be solid blocks,” persisted the
girl, rising to walk nervously back and forth before
the walls. “There must be a space left inside.
And see! the major’s bed stands close to the outer
wall, which is the thickest of all.”</p>
<p class="pnext">He stared at her in amazement and then, realizing
the meaning of her words, sprang to his
feet. Beth was equally amazed and looked at her
cousin in wonder.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, Patsy!” she exclaimed, “the baby hasn’t
been lost at all.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Of course not,” declared Patsy, her great
eyes brilliant with inspiration. “<em class="italics">She’s imprisoned!</em>”</p>

<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-xiianother-disappearance">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id13">CHAPTER XII—ANOTHER DISAPPEARANCE</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">For a time the three stood regarding one another
with startled eyes. Then Arthur gasped:
“Great heaven! what fools we’ve been.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Come!” cried Patsy. “The nursery.”</p>
<p class="pnext">They rushed down the corridors to the staircase
and thence into the court. The door of the
nursery stood ajar and Arthur first entered and
lighted a lamp.</p>
<p class="pnext">The light fell full upon the face of a man
seated in a low rocking chair and holding a half
smoked cigarette in his mouth. He was fast
asleep. It was old Miguel, the ranchero.</p>
<p class="pnext">Arthur shook his shoulder, savagely, and the
man wakened and rubbed his eyes. Then, seeing
who had disturbed him, he quickly rose and made
his characteristic low, sweeping bow.</p>
<p class="pnext">“What are you doing here?” demanded Weldon,
angry and suspicious.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I am look for Mees Jane,” returned the old
man calmly.</p>
<p class="pnext">“In your sleep? Come, get out of here.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Wait a minute, Arthur,” said Beth, reading
Miguel’s face. “He knows something.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Arthur looked at the man critically, reflecting
that there must be a reason for his presence
in the nursery. Miguel had been fond of baby
Jane. Was he merely disconsolate over her loss,
or—did he really “know something”?</p>
<p class="pnext">“Miguel once told me,” said Patsy, speaking
slowly, “that he used to live in this house, in
Cristoval’s time, and knows it thoroughly.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The old man bowed.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I theenk,” said he, “perhaps we find Mees
Jane here—not somewhere else.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Why do you think that, Miguel?”</p>
<p class="pnext">It was Patsy who questioned him. He mused
a bit before replying.</p>
<p class="pnext">“The old señor—the father of my Señor
Cristoval—was strange mans,” said he. “He
make thees house a funny way. Come; I show
you.”</p>
<p class="pnext">He led the way to the little room adjoining,
the one Inez had occupied. In one corner of the
floor was a square hole, with steps leading down
to a sort of blind pocket. Holding a lamp in
one hand Miguel descended the steps and pushed
against a block of adobe that formed part of the
outer wall. It swung inward, disclosing a cavity
about four feet in width and fully six feet high.
The interior could be plainly seen from the
room, by stooping close to the floor. There were
shelves in the cavity and upon one of them stood
a jar of milk.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh,” cried Patsy, clasping her hands together.
“I told you the wall was hollow!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Arthur followed Miguel down the steps. He
took the lamp and examined the little room. All
the walls that formed it seemed solid.</p>
<p class="pnext">Miguel was holding the block that served as
a door. He released his hold, when Arthur had
again ascended, and the block swung back into
place.</p>
<p class="pnext">As they returned to the nursery, Weldon asked:</p>
<p class="pnext">“Do you know of any other rooms in the
wall, Miguel?”</p>
<p class="pnext">The man shook his head, uncertainly.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I know there be other rooms in thees wall,”
said he, “for Señor Cristoval have told me so.
Hees father make the places to keep things safe
from robbers—perhaps to hide from others, too.
But where such places are ees the secret of the
Cristovals. The room I show you ees all I know
about. I thought that was secret, too; but no;
the New York nurse tell Inez of that room, an’
Inez she keep Mees Jane’s milk there, to be cool.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Mildred told of the room!” exclaimed Arthur
in astonishment.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes,” said Beth, “she used to visit this
house as a girl, when Cristoval lived here, and
she must have known some of the secret rooms.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Ah, that ees what I theenk,” agreed old
Miguel. “There ees more room in thees wall;
that I know. If thees Mildreed know one room,
she may know more. So I theenk she and Inez
have go into some room of the wall an’ take
Mees Jane with them. Some way, they cannot
get out again.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Exactly!” cried Patsy triumphantly. “They
are somewhere in that wall, imprisoned, and the
major really heard the baby cry.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But—Miguel, Miguel!” pleaded Arthur,
earnestly, “can’t you remember how the wall
opens? Think! Think carefully.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I do theenk, Meest Weld; I theenk till I go
sleep, an’ you find me here.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Now, let’s do some thinking ourselves,” suggested
Beth. “The opening that leads into the
wall must be from this very room. Miguel
thinks so, too, and that’s why he came here. Let
us examine the wall.”</p>
<p class="pnext">They undertook to do this, holding the lamps
close to the adobe blocks and inspecting every
crack. The cement used in joining the blocks
had crumbled away at the outer edges in almost
every instance, and it was impossible to tell if any
block was removable or not. Miguel or Arthur
pushed hard against every block in the room,
from those nearest the floor to those far above
their heads; but not one yielded a hair’s breadth.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Suppose we go outside,” said Patsy. “Perhaps there
is some window, or grating, that will
give us a clue.”</p>
<p class="pnext">So they took old Miguel’s lantern and went
into the garden where they could view the outer
side of the wall. A tangle of climbing vines
grew against the wing, but there was no window
or other opening on the first floor. Above, on
the second floor, were two windows, one of which
admitted light and air to the blue room.</p>
<p class="pnext">“How about the other window?” asked
Beth.</p>
<p class="pnext">“That,” said Arthur, “must be in an unused
room at the end of the corridor. We have never
furnished it.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I think it might be well to examine that
room,” suggested Patsy.</p>
<p class="pnext">So they reentered the house and, followed by
Miguel, ascended to the second floor. The door
of the library was ajar and those seated there,
seeing Arthur and the girls pass, came trooping
out to ask what they were doing.</p>
<p class="pnext">Patsy briefly explained the new theory they
had conceived to account for the disappearance
of baby and the two nurses, and the idea was
so startling that all became eager to join in
the investigation.</p>
<p class="pnext">They invaded the vacant room in a body, several
of the men carrying lamps. It was in size
and shape a duplicate of the blue room, with its
one window deeply embedded in the wall, the
surface of the embrasure being covered with
heavy redwood planks.</p>
<p class="pnext">From the fact that this room lay directly
over the small one occupied by Inez, in which
was the wall cavity they had recently explored,
they conceived the idea that the wall here might
also be hollow. Pounding upon it, however, had
no effect in determining this, for kiln-baked adobe
is not resonant and it was impossible to discover
from any surface indication whether there
were eight feet of closely set blocks or less.
Careful search for any sign of an opening proved
futile.</p>
<p class="pnext">Finally old Miguel said:</p>
<p class="pnext">“Next room was room of Señor Cristoval.
Eet was room hees father live in, too; the old
señor who build thees part of house. If there
ees way to get in wall, from upstairs, it ees there.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“To be sure,” said practical Beth, catching at
the suggestion; “it was there that Major Doyle
heard the baby cry.”</p>
<p class="pnext">So on they all trooped into the blue room,
where the wall was likewise carefully inspected.
While this was being done Rudolph looked at his
watch and found it was after four o’clock.</p>
<p class="pnext">“It will soon be daylight,” said he to his wife.
“What a night it has been! It seems a month
since we arrived here and found Toodlums gone.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Old Miguel had been silent and unobtrusive in
the vacant room, but here he was as eager in
testing the wall as any one of them.</p>
<p class="pnext">“You see, it’s this way,” Patsy was saying;
“if the major could hear baby cry, through
this wall, those inside could hear us, if we called
to them. Who among us has the clearest, the
most penetrating voice?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Suppose <em class="italics">I</em> try?” squeaked Runyon, earnestly;
but those who considered the remark at all
merely gave him scornful looks.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Let Rudolph call,” said Helen. “I think
his voice might penetrate the pyramids of Egypt.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Rudolph went close to the wall and shouted:</p>
<p class="pnext">“Hello, there! Baby! I-nez!—eh—eh—what’s
the other girl’s name?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Mildred,” said Beth.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Mil-dred!” shouted Dolph; “Mil-dred!”</p>
<p class="pnext">He paused between each name, which he
roared so loudly that he nearly deafened those
in the room, and everyone listened intently for a
response.</p>
<p class="pnext">No answer.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Perhaps they’re asleep—worn out,” said
Uncle John. No one now seemed to doubt that
the missing ones were imprisoned in the wall.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Let Beth try,” suggested Patsy.</p>
<p class="pnext">Beth had a clear, bell-like voice and from where
she stood she called out the names of Inez and
Mildred. Then, in the stillness that followed,
came a muffled cry in return—a cry that set all
their nerves quivering with excitement.</p>
<p class="pnext">The mystery was solved at last.</p>
<p class="pnext">Beth repeated the call and now the answer was
clearer, though still indistinguishable. It was a
voice, indeed, but whose voice they could not
tell. But now, to their astonishment, came another
sound, quite clear and distinct—the wail
of a baby voice.</p>
<p class="pnext">“That settles it!” cried the major, triumphantly.
“Was I right, or wrong? Was it a
nightmare, or was I crazy?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Neither one, my dear sir,” replied the doctor.
“You declared you heard a ghost.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Arthur was capering about in frantic joy.</p>
<p class="pnext">“She’s alive—my baby is alive!” he exclaimed.</p>
<p class="pnext">“And probably she was sound asleep until your
infernal yelling awakened her,” added the major.</p>
<p class="pnext">“It wasn’t <em class="italics">our</em> yelling,” said Uncle John, as
delighted as even the father could be; “it was
the yelling of whoever is inside, there, that
frightened the baby. Thank goodness the dear
child could sleep during all these weary hours,
when we have been wearing our hearts out with
anxiety.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“We have yet cause for anxiety,” declared
Patsy, “for little Jane is not rescued yet, by any
means, and presently the poor thing will become
very hungry and suffer for lack of food. We
now know where baby is, but we can’t get at
her; nor can Mildred or Inez find a way to
get her out, or they would have done so long
ago.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Very true,” agreed Helen Hahn, gravely.
“Unless we can soon find a way to get to them,
all three will starve.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Why, we will pull down the wall!” cried
Arthur.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Dynamite it!” piped Bul Run.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Be sensible!” counseled Uncle John sternly.
“We are wasting precious time. Miguel,” turning
to the ranchero, “get some of your men, with
picks and crowbars, and fetch them here quickly.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The Mexican, who seemed bewildered by the
discovery of the missing ones, although he had
himself been the first to suspect where they were,
started at once to obey this order. When he
had gone, Patsy said:</p>
<p class="pnext">“Of course there is some easy way to get
inside the wall, and to get out again. Are we so
stupid that none of us can penetrate the secret
of the cunning Spaniard who built this place?”</p>
<p class="pnext">The challenge merely led them to regard one
another with perplexed looks.</p>
<p class="pnext">“The fact that they’re alive, after all these
hours,” said young Hahn, “is proof that they
are supplied with air, and plenty of it. Then
there is an opening, somewhere or other.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Also,” added Arthur, reflectively, “they are
now opposite the second story rooms, when they
must have entered the hollow wall at the first
floor—perhaps from the nursery. That proves
there is a stairway, or at least a ladder, inside.”</p>
<p class="pnext">At this moment a maid entered to say that
Mrs. Weldon had awakened and was calling
hysterically for her baby. The doctor and Patsy
at once hurried to Louise’s bedside, where the
girl said:</p>
<p class="pnext">“Don’t worry, dear. Little Jane has been
found and is now in this very house. So try to
be quiet and go to sleep again.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Bring her to me; bring my darling at once!”
begged Louise. But the doctor now interfered.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I don’t wish to disturb baby at present,” he
said positively. “I think the child is sleeping.
You have been quite ill, Mrs. Weldon, and I must
insist on your remaining quiet. Here; drink
this, if you please.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Louise, reassured, drank the potion and presently
sank into another doze. Dr. Knox remained
beside her for a time but Patsy hurried back to
the blue room, eager to assist in the rescue of the
prisoners.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’m afraid we’re a stupid lot,” Uncle John
was saying as she entered; “or else the Spanish
don was remarkably clever. We know the wall
is hollow, and we know there’s an opening, yet
we can’t solve the riddle.”</p>
<p class="pnext">But here came Miguel and two strong men
laden with steel bars, cold chisels and picks. For
a time it was a quandary where to attack the wall,
but Arthur finally chose the place just back of
the bed and bade the men begin their work.</p>
<p class="pnext">The adobe proved harder than the hardest
brick. Old Miguel knew that it must be broken
away bit by bit, for he was not unacquainted
with the material, yet even under his skillful
direction the work progressed with aggravating
slowness.</p>
<p class="pnext">Daylight gradually crept into the room and
rendered lamps unnecessary. The morning discovered
a very disheveled, heavy-eyed group, not
a single member of which was willing to retire
from the fascinating scene of rescue.</p>
<p class="pnext">Patsy went away to arouse Sing Fing and
the servants, some of whom she found had remained
awake all night. In half an hour steaming
hot coffee was brought to the blue room and
gratefully consumed by the weary watchers.
Breakfast of a substantial character would soon
be ready and it was agreed that part of them
should eat at one time while the others remained
to watch and to call them promptly if anything
new developed.</p>
<p class="pnext">Arthur, too nervous to stand idly by, insisted
on attacking the wall in another place and Runyon
assisted him, the latter’s strength and muscle
winning the admiration of all observers. He
worked fiercely for a time, driving in the bar
with stalwart blows and chipping off huge pieces
of adobe. Then, dripping with perspiration, he
retired in favor of Arthur and rested by taking
a seat in the window, where the cool morning
air could fan him.</p>
<p class="pnext">Patsy noticed Runyon in this position, his back
against the redwood planks and his legs stretched
out on the window-seat; but the work on the
wall drew her attention, as it did that of everyone
else.</p>
<p class="pnext">Suddenly there was a crash and a loud report—followed
by a shrill cry—and as every eye
turned to the window they found that Runyon’s
great body had absolutely disappeared. A rush
was made to the window, but he did not seem
to have fallen out. There was no sign of him at
all. As if by magic, he was gone.</p>
<p class="pnext">While they stood amazed and half frightened
by the marvel of the thing, Patsy recovered
sufficiently to say:</p>
<p class="pnext">“Quick—let us get below! He must be under
those rose vines, perhaps crushed and badly
hurt.”</p>
<p class="pnext">So they made for the door and flocked downstairs
and out into the garden. The vines seemed
undisturbed. When the men pushed them aside
there was no evidence of the big rancher to be
seen. In fact, they were all convinced that Runyon
had not fallen out of the window.</p>
<p class="pnext">Slowly they returned to the blue room, where
the major exclaimed, with positive emphasis:</p>
<p class="pnext">“This room is haunted. Don’t talk to me!
There’s no other explanation. If we don’t
watch out, we’ll all disappear—and that’ll be
the end of us!”</p>

<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id14">CHAPTER XIII—THE WAY IT HAPPENED</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">Through consideration for the nerves and perhaps
the credulity of the reader, it may be advisable
at this juncture to go a little back in our
story and relate the circumstances which led to
the present perplexing crisis. A great detective
once said that “every mystery has a simple
solution”—meaning, of course, that the solution
is simple when once discovered. Therefore,
the puzzling mystery of the disappearance of baby
Jane and her two nurses, followed later by the
vanishment of Mr. Bulwer Runyon, was due to
the one-time idiosyncracy of a certain Señor
Cristoval, happily deceased, rather than to any
supernatural agency.</p>
<p class="pnext">Until now we have only known Mildred
Travers, as she called herself, in a casual way.
We know that she was considered a competent
nurse and had proved her capability in the care
of baby Jane. Also we know that she was silent
and reserved and that her eyes bore an habitual
expression that was hard and repellent. Without
being able to find any especial fault with the
girl, no one was attracted toward her—always
excepting the baby, who could not be expected to
show discrimination at her tender age.</p>
<p class="pnext">A little of Mildred’s former history had escaped
her, but not enough to judge her by. She had
once lived in Southern California, near this very
place. She had visited this house frequently with
her father, when a small child, and old Señor
Cristoval had confided to her some of the secrets
of the mansion. That was all. What had become
of friends and family, how she went to
New York and studied nursing, or what might
account for that hard look in her eyes, no one
now acquainted with her knew.</p>
<p class="pnext">The Mexican girl, Inez, was nearly as peculiar
and unaccountable as Mildred. There was no
mystery about her, however, except that she was
so capable and intelligent, considering her antecedents.
Inez’ people lived in a small town in
another part of the county and the girl was one
of a numerous brood of children whose parents
were indolent, dissipated and steeped in ignorance.
When fourteen years old she had left
home to work for some of the neighboring
ranchers, never staying in one place long but
generally liked by her employers. The woman
who had recommended Inez to Mrs. Weldon said
she was bright and willing and more intelligent
than most Mexicans of her class, but that she
possessed a violent temper.</p>
<p class="pnext">Louise had seen little evidence of that temper,
however, for Inez from the first loved her new
mistress and idolized the baby. It was only after
Mildred came to supplant her, as she thought,
that the girl developed an unreasoning, passionate
hatred for the other nurse and was jealous of
every attention Mildred lavished upon the little
one.</p>
<p class="pnext">The baby was impartial. She laughed and held
out her chubby fists to either nurse, perhaps
realizing that both were kind to her. It was this
that made Inez so furious and caused Mildred
to disdain the Mexican girl. The two were at
sword’s points from the first, although after a
little Mildred made an attempt to conciliate Inez,
knowing that the untutored Mexican was by
nature irresponsible and jealous, but withal loving
and generous.</p>
<p class="pnext">Inez did not respond to these advances, but as
the days passed she became less sullen when in
the presence of Mildred, and at times, when
busied over her duties, so far forgot her animosity
as to converse with her in her old careless,
unaffected way. Only Mildred was able to
note this slight change, and it encouraged her to
believe she might win Inez’ confidence in the
end. Inez herself did not realize that she had
changed toward the “witch-woman,” and when
brooding over her fancied wrongs hated Mildred
as cordially as ever.</p>
<p class="pnext">On the day when the Weldons and their guests
rode into town, the two nurses had indulged in
a longer and more friendly conversation than
usual. It began by Mildred’s chiding the Mexican
for taking baby to the quarters unknown to
her, as she had been obliged to follow to see
what had become of the child. Inez retorted by
accusing Mildred of spying upon her. Their return
to the house was anything but friendly, and
Inez flatly refused to obey such instructions as
Mildred gave her for the care of baby. She
even walked out of the court in a temper and was
gone for an hour. Then she stole in, a little
ashamed of her revolt, but still defiant and
rebellious.</p>
<p class="pnext">They were in the nursery and Mildred pretended
not to notice her assistant’s mood.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I have prepared two bottles of baby’s food,”
said she. “Please place one in the hollow of
the wall, in your room, to keep cool until we
need it.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I won’t!” said Inez.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Why not?” asked Mildred quietly.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Because you are witch-woman,” cried the
Mexican; “because you use bad magic to make
hollow in wall; because you try to make baby
witch-woman, like yourself, by keeping her milk
in the witch-place; because—because—I <em class="italics">hate</em>
you!” she concluded with a passionate stamp of
her foot.</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred looked upon the girl pityingly as she
crossed herself again and again as if in defiance
of the supposed witchcraft. The poor girl sought
by this method to ward off any evil charm Mildred
might attempt in retaliation, and the action
nettled the trained nurse because the unjust
accusation was so sincerely made.</p>
<p class="pnext">She slowly rose and taking the bottle of milk
carried it herself to the hollow in the wall and
placed it upon a shelf. Then, returning, she
stood before the petulant, crouching Mexican and
said gently:</p>
<p class="pnext">“Were I truly a witch, Inez, I would not be
working as a nurse—just as you are. Nor do
I know any magic, more than you yourself
know.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Then how you know about that hole in
the wall?” demanded Inez.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I wish you would let me explain that. Indeed,
I think a good talk together will do us both
good. Take this chair beside me, and try to
believe in my good will. I do not hate you,
Inez. I wish you did not hate me.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Inez slowly rose from the floor and seated
herself in the chair, turning it so that she could
eye Mildred’s face as she spoke.</p>
<p class="pnext">“When I was a girl,” continued Mildred, “I
often came to this house to visit. Sometimes I
stayed here for several days, while my father
talked with his old friend, old Señor Cristoval.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“That is a lie,” asserted Inez. “I have ask
Miguel, who is here forty years, an’ was house
servant for Señor Cristoval. Miguel say there
is no Señor Travers who is friend of Señor
Cristoval. No Señor Travers did ever come to
this house for visit. What you say to that,
Witch-Woman?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred flushed and seemed embarrassed.
Then she answered calmly:</p>
<p class="pnext">“I think Miguel speaks truly, for my father
did not bear the name of Travers. He was
called by another name.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Then why do you call yourself Travers?”
retorted the other.</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred hesitated.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I did not like my old name,” she said, “and
so I changed it. But this is a secret I have told
you, Inez, and you must not tell anyone of it.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Inez nodded, looking at the other curiously.
This confession had aroused her sympathy, for
the first time, for her fellow nurse. The fact
that there was a secret between them dissolved
to an extent her antipathy for Mildred, and it
might be a bond to eventually draw them nearer
together. With more tolerance than she had yet
shown she asked:</p>
<p class="pnext">“Did Señor Cristoval show you the secrets of
this house?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes. I was a little girl and he was good to
me. I am not a witch-woman, Inez. Oh, if I
were, I would witch a little happiness into my
life!” she added miserably.</p>
<p class="pnext">This burst of rebellious longing interested Inez
even more than the secret. She could understand
such a protest against fate.</p>
<p class="pnext">“At first,” continued Mildred, reverting to her
former cold speech, while the hard look, which
for an instant had given way to a flash of sentiment,
again crept into her eyes, “I thought I
had forgotten the queer recesses and secret rooms
built by the elder Cristoval; but now I am beginning
to remember them. In the days when
this wing was built, the country was wild and
lawless. Robbers often visited a house in broad
daylight and took away all that was of value;
so the first Cristoval—the father of the one I
knew—made the secret place to hide his treasure
in, and even to hide himself and his family if
the thieves threatened them.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Is the treasure there now?” asked Inez
eagerly.</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred frowned, as if the question displeased
her.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Of course not. That was long ago. When I
was a girl they no longer needed the rooms in
the wall as a hiding-place from thieves; but they
kept them secret, just the same. I think I am the
only person Señor Cristoval ever told. He did
it to please me, I suppose, because I was a child.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Inez was much impressed. She began to regard
Mildred more amicably. If she were not
a witch-woman, she reflected, there was no reason
to fear her. The Mexican girl thought deeply
on what she had heard, during the next half
hour. She watched Mildred put the baby to
sleep and then take up a book to read as she sat
beside the crib. Inez went out into the deserted
court and squatting beside the fountain pondered
upon the fascinating mysteries of the old house.</p>
<p class="pnext">She crept back, presently, and reentered the
nursery where Mildred was sitting.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Tell me,” she began, in a friendly and
familiar way that was new in her relations with
the other girl, “are there indeed rooms hidden
in these walls—big enough for people to hide
in?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred smiled and laid down her book. Inez
in this mood was worth cultivating, if she hoped
to win her confidence. It would be far easier to
get on in her new situation if Inez would learn
to like her.</p>
<p class="pnext">Another thing influenced her: a reflection that
had not been absent from her mind since the
Weldons departed for the day and had left her
practically in charge of the house. She had
come to this house for a purpose. Could that purpose
be best accomplished to-day, or at some
later period?</p>
<p class="pnext">“I believe,” she answered musingly, “that this
wall back of us is hollow and contains several
rooms, which may be entered at various secret
places—if one knows where the places are.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“They cannot be very big rooms,” said Inez
in a hushed, awed voice, as she glanced at the
wall.</p>
<p class="pnext">“No; they must be narrow. But they are
quite long and high—some of them—and there
are stairs leading from one floor to another, just
like the big stairs in the hall.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Inez stared at her.</p>
<p class="pnext">“How you know that?” she inquired.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Why, I’ve seen the rooms,” was the reply.
“Let me think a moment.”</p>
<p class="pnext">During the pause she scrutinized the Mexican
girl closely, wondering if it would be advisable
to take her into her confidence. Then she continued,
speaking slowly:</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’m almost sure it was in this very room that
one of the secret entrances was built. It was
not a nursery when I was here before, you know;
it was Señor Cristoval’s office, where he kept
his books and his money-boxes.”</p>
<p class="pnext">She rose, as she spoke, and looked uncertainly
up and down the wall. Then, with a nod of
satisfaction, she quickly walked to the east corner
and counted four blocks of adobe, starting from
the floor. The fourth line of blocks she followed
to the third one, and placed her hand upon it.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I think I am right, so far,” she said. “This
is the door to the secret rooms, but the key that
unlocks it is somewhere in the floor. Turn back
the rug, please, Inez.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The girl obeyed, her brown fingers trembling
with excitement. The floor was of adobe blocks
similar to those which formed the wall, but
smaller in size. Mildred regarded them reflectively
and then placed her foot on the edge of the
second block directly in a line with the place
where her hand rested. The pressure of her foot
made the block tip slightly, and observing this
she pressed hard with her hand against the inner
edge of the upper block.</p>
<p class="pnext">The result seemed magical. Three seemingly
solid blocks of the wall swung slowly outward,
disclosing a dimly lighted recess beyond.</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred stepped in, stooping her head slightly
because the opening was so small. Inez followed
her, nervously seizing the other girl’s hand for
support. The light seemed to come from some
place far above and as their eyes grew accustomed
to it they could discern a passage about
three feet in width and fourteen feet long, which
occupied the center of the wall. At the right, a
flight of steps led upward, and to their left the
place was occupied by some chairs and stools.
Against the walls were several narrow shelves,
easily reached by one standing upright.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Why, they have left the place furnished, just
as it was when Señor Cristoval first showed it to
me,” said Mildred. “The mattings and upholstery
must be ready to fall to pieces, by this
time; but you see, Inez, I was right about the
secret rooms.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Just then little Jane wakened with a lusty cry.</p>
<p class="pnext">“See to the baby,” said Mildred quickly, and
the Mexican girl reluctantly turned away to obey.</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred remained in the recess, thoughtfully
eyeing the various antique objects which had been
allowed to remain there, some of which were of
real value. She reflected that the last Cristoval
had doubtless passed away without disclosing the
secret of the wall to anyone, and his executors,
in selling the mansion, had been quite unaware
that anything was hidden in the adobe wall.
Without doubt the property might now be justly
claimed by the new owner, Arthur Weldon, and
this thought made Mildred flush with eager resolve
to take full advantage of her present opportunity.
For here was the consummation of her
hopes; here was the realization of the important
plan which had brought her to Southern California
and to this house.</p>
<p class="pnext">Inez had caught the baby from its cradle and,
holding a bottle of fresh milk-food to its lips
to comfort it, again advanced through the opening.
Mildred had stepped a few paces along the
passage and Inez, the baby in her arms, started
to join her.</p>
<p class="pnext">At that moment she heard a sound in the
court, as of some one approaching, and to avoid
letting others know of this fascinating secret the
girl thoughtlessly grasped the adobe door with
her free hand and swung it shut behind her.</p>
<p class="pnext">It closed with a sharp “click!” and Mildred,
hearing the sound, turned with a low cry of fear.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Great heavens, what have you done?” she
exclaimed in tense tones and brushing the Mexican
aside she threw her whole weight against
the wall. It did not yield a hair’s breadth.</p>
<p class="pnext">Inez, with terror in her eyes, stared at her
companion.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Is it lock?” she whispered.</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred pushed again, straining every muscle.
Then she bent and examined the wall. It was
easy to see, from this side, where the series of
three blocks were firmly joined together. Also
the butts of three huge iron hinges protruded
slightly into the passage. There could be no mistake.
The closing of the door had made them
prisoners.</p>
</div>
<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-xivprisoners-of-the-wall">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id15">CHAPTER XIV—PRISONERS OF THE WALL</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">Mildred silently turned and regarded her companion.
Her eyes were not hard and cold now.
They were glowing with anxiety and terror.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Cannot we get out?” demanded Inez.</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred shook her head.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Not the way we came in,” she replied. “I
remember now that Cristoval warned me never
to close the door behind me; but I forgot to tell
you that, so you are not to blame.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Inez looked down at baby, who had again fallen
asleep, snuggled close to her breast. Her fear
at this time was not for herself. It was dreadful
to think of the danger she had placed the
darling baby in—the child she would have died
rather than injure.</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred saw the look and read its anguish.
Her own cheeks blanched for a moment, but
there was an inherent quality of courage in this
girl that forbade her to despair. Speaking as
much to herself as to Inez she said:</p>
<p class="pnext">“We were able to open this adobe door only
by pressing downward on a block of the floor
outside, which released a catch which is securely
hidden in the lower edge of the opening—where
I cannot reach it. So, unless some one
knew the secret and could press that block in
the nursery, the door cannot again be opened.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Inez staggered to a stool and sat down.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Must we stay here always?” she pleaded
piteously.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I think not. I am <em class="italics">sure</em> not, Inez. They will
find some way to break through the wall and
rescue us.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But no one knows we are here!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“True. Well, I believe there are other ways
to get out of this hollow wall, besides the opening
we came through. I am quite certain I was
told that Señor Cristoval could enter from his
room, on the second floor; and perhaps there
are other entrances. Stay here and keep baby
quiet and I will make an examination of our
prison.”</p>
<p class="pnext">As she started to ascend the stairs Inez arose
to follow her.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Let me come, too,” she begged. “I am
afraid to stay alone.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Very well; but try not to waken baby.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The stairs were built the full width of the
space, completely blocking it at that end. At the
top they stepped into another narrow room, which
was not over the lower one but extended farther
along the wall. It was, indeed, extraordinary to
note how comfortable the genius of that ancient
Cristoval who had planned the place, had made
this originally comfortless corridor-like room, for
room it was despite its narrow confines.</p>
<p class="pnext">The ceiling was high, and light and air were admitted
by gratings placed at the top, letting onto
the bastion of the roof, where they could not be
observed by those below. The gratings were
covered by projections that kept out the rain and
dew. On the floor was a thick carpet, somewhat
musty and dusty now, and at the far end was
placed a couch with silken curtains. This was
still piled high with bedding and pillows and
was boxed in, the full width of the passage, with
elaborately carved woods. Upholstered seats,
rather narrow but long and quite comfortable,
were built against the wall and supported by richly
carved frames of ebony and panels of cherry.
There were pictures upon the walls; oil paintings
of quite good quality. A sort of wall-cabinet
and some small brackets supported numerous
hooks, ornaments, and several boxes of metal and
sandalwood, which last Mildred eyed expectantly
but had now no leisure to examine.</p>
<p class="pnext">The girls were both awed by this discovery,
for Mildred had never been permitted to mount
the stair to this room when Señor Cristoval had
allowed her to peep into the lower passage. The
intense silence lent a weirdness to the place that
was at first quite disconcerting. A gray rat
scuttled along the carpet, causing them to jump
and cry out, and then disappeared somewhere
beneath the couch. Inez, trembling with nervous
fear, hugged the baby with one arm and clutched
Mildred’s arm with the other, and then they sat
together on one of the cushioned seats and tried
to collect their thoughts.</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred reflected that no person had entered
this place for at least eight years, for it was eight
years since the last Cristoval had passed to his
fathers. Yet, aside from the dust, everything
seemed in an excellent state of preservation.
The secret room had been fitted up by its builder
more than fifty years before and much of the
furnishings must have been placed there then.</p>
<p class="pnext">“My first task,” she said to Inez, “must be to
make a thorough examination of this place.
Since there is no one to help us, we must help
ourselves, and any weakness at this time would
be fatal.”</p>
<p class="pnext">With this she rose and carefully began to inspect
the walls. The heavy carpet was merely
laid flat on the adobe floor and she raised it here
and there and tested the blocks to see if any was
movable. There was no means of reaching the
ceiling but an opening there was out of the question.</p>
<p class="pnext">Near the center of the room, on the inner wall
and about two feet from the floor, was a square
of wood firmly embedded in the adobe. This, she
thought, might possibly be a means of egress or
ingress, so she tested it eagerly, pressing not only
upon the wood but on all the blocks of adobe near
it, in the endeavor to discover a hidden spring or
some other clever mechanical contrivance which
would prove the “open sesame.” But the panel
and the wall defied all her efforts and she finally
concluded it was solid planking placed there to
support the wall or to allow cupboards or shelves
to be nailed against it.</p>
<p class="pnext">Another similar place, where a huge panel of
plank was set in the wall, she found at the very
end of the passage, beyond the couch, and was
only able to reach it by mounting the bed and
climbing over the bedding. This panel was also
immovable and she decided it could not be an
opening because the wall beyond it was doubtless
solid. This space beyond the bed, where the
room ended, contained a huge chest of quaintly
carved oak. As she saw the chest her heart gave
a great bound and forgetting for the moment her
desire to escape she reached down and raised the
lid.</p>
<p class="pnext">Then her face fell. Despite the dim light in
this corner, which she had grown somewhat accustomed
to in investigating the panel, she could
see that the chest contained merely papers, with
which it was half filled. This might be the accumulated
correspondence of the Cristovals, of
no use to any but themselves, and losing all interest
in the chest she closed the lid and again
crossed over the high bed to Inez.</p>
<p class="pnext">The result of this investigation, which had
consumed a full hour, so thorough had she been,
convinced Mildred that there was no immediate
way for them to leave their prison. So she began
to plan how they might keep themselves and
baby Jane comfortable until they were rescued.</p>
<p class="pnext">The bottle of milk, which Inez still held in
her hand, was a prepared food of a highly nourishing
quality. The contents of the bottle had
scarcely been touched by baby when, rousing
from her sleep, she had been taken up and comforted
by Inez until slumber again overtook her.
Usually Jane consumed two bottles of such food
each day, and another during each night.</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred looked at her watch and found it was
nearly four o’clock. With a little care in its administration
the baby’s food might last until
morning, but not longer. For themselves, they
must be content without food, unless—</p>
<p class="pnext">She decided to search the boxes and shelves
while daylight lasted, and bade Inez place the
sleeping infant on one of the cushioned seats and
support it with a pillow brought from the couch.
Then the two girls began to take down the boxes
from the shelves and explore their contents.
Some were of tin and square in shape; others
were round, like canisters.</p>
<p class="pnext">In one they found some tea and in another a
small quantity of loaf sugar. There was no other
food, except a few cracker crumbs in the bottom
of a tin.</p>
<p class="pnext">Leaving Inez to sit beside baby, Mildred next
visited the room below. Here the light was more
dim, but she discovered a box of wax candles—two
or three dozen in number—and a quantity
of matches in a small iron safe. She tried these
last and after several attempts managed to light
one of them and with it light a candle. The
matches were at least eight years old, but there
was not a particle of dampness in the place and
so they had not greatly deteriorated.</p>
<p class="pnext">A broad slab of redwood, hinged and fastened
to the wall by turn-buttons, was made to let down
and serve as a table. When Mildred lowered it
she found that it covered a small recess or cupboard
in the wall, in which stood three tin cans.
One was labeled “tomatoes” and the other two
“corn.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Here was food, of a certain sort; but the cans
were tightly soldered and there seemed to be no
tool that might be used to open them. Although
the place was littered with many small articles
there was nothing else among them that especially
interested the girl. Two sabers were
crossed upon the wall over the table, and below
them hung a big revolver. A panama hat, yellowed
with age, hung upon a peg. A broom
made of palm fiber stood in a corner.</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred returned to the upper floor, carrying
with her several candles and some matches.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Inez,” said she, “we must make the best of
our misfortune. I hope that before long we shall
be rescued, both on baby’s account and on our
own. There are some tins of tomatoes and
corn down stairs, but nothing that baby could
eat. However, we shall suffer more from thirst
than from hunger, as there is not a drop of water
in the place.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Inez had been thinking during Mildred’s absence.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Can we not scream, and so make them hear
us?” she asked.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I have thought of that and we will make the
attempt. The servants are all in the opposite
wing, so it is useless to try to arouse their attention;
but when Mr. and Mrs. Weldon return,
with the others, they may be able to hear us
and so rescue us.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“When will they be back?” Inez inquired.</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred considered this question.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I heard them say they were to stay in town
for luncheon, but Mrs. Weldon remarked that
they would be back soon after. I think, Inez, they
may already have returned and even now may be
searching for us. Stay here, and I will go below,
so as not to disturb baby, and call.”</p>
<p class="pnext">She went again down the steep stairs to the
lower room where, standing near to the place
where they had come through the wall, she
uttered a sharp, shrill cry, such as she thought
might penetrate the thick blocks of adobe. The
sound echoed with startling reverberations
through the secret chambers and baby Jane, wakening
in affright, set up a series of such lusty
screams that it seemed as if they ought to be
heard a mile away.</p>
<p class="pnext">Inez did her best to soothe and quiet the baby,
but succeeded only when she had given little Jane
the precious bottle of milk.</p>
</div>
<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-xvmildred-confides-in-inez">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id16">CHAPTER XV—MILDRED CONFIDES IN INEZ</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">Mildred had hastened upstairs in alarm at the
pandemonium of sound her own cry had aroused,
for the baby’s screams also gave back a thousand
echoes and these sent the little one into fresh
paroxysms of terror.</p>
<p class="pnext">“This won’t do, at all,” she said anxiously,
when baby Jane had sobbed herself into a doze,
with the bottle to comfort her. “If we scream
again it will frighten the child to death.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Perhaps they have heard us,” suggested Inez,
rocking Jane to and fro in her arms.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Perhaps. Let us hope so,” sighed Mildred.</p>
<p class="pnext">Presently she went over to the couch and examined
the condition of the bedding. The linen
sheets had withstood the years very well, but the
blankets and coverlets had a musty smell. She
spread some of these out to air and then went
back and sat beside Inez.</p>
<p class="pnext">Together they watched the light fade until the
narrow space was full of creeping shadows. The
air began to grow chilly, so Mildred arranged the
couch and they laid baby Jane upon it, covered
her snugly with a blanket and drew the silk curtain
to shield her eyes from the glare of the
candles. They had lighted several of these, placing
them in heavy brass candlesticks which they
found ranged upon the shelves. Each of the
girls took a blanket and folded it about her and
then they sat down together to await their fate
as patiently as they could.</p>
<p class="pnext">They both realized, by this time, that their dilemma
was likely to prove serious. Not a sound
from within the house penetrated the adobe walls
of their prison. They were unable to tell if their
whereabout had yet been discovered.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I think it best to wait until morning before
we make any further effort to be heard,” said
Mildred. “Our cries would only distract baby
and if our screams have not already attracted
notice it would be folly to continue them. Anyway,
let us try to be brave and patient. Something
may happen to save us, before morning.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Even by the flickering candle-light the place
was awesome and uncanny. Inez crept closer to
Mildred’s side, quite forgetting her former aversion
for her companion. Because the sound of
their own voices lent them a certain degree of
courage they conversed together in low tones,
talking on any subject that occurred to them.</p>
<p class="pnext">At one time Inez broke an oppressive stillness
by saying:</p>
<p class="pnext">“Tell me about yourself—when you were a
girl. And why did you leave here to go to New
York?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred regarded the girl musingly. She felt
a strong temptation to speak, to confide in some
one.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Will you keep my secret, Inez?” she asked.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes; of course. I do not tell all I know,”
was the reply.</p>
<p class="pnext">“If you told, it would drive me away from
here,” said Mildred.</p>
<p class="pnext">Inez gave a start, remembering that a few
hours ago she would have done anything to drive
Mildred away. But, somehow, she had come to
regard her companion in misfortune more favorably.
A bond of sympathy had been established
between them by this terrible experience they
were now undergoing. Whatever their fate
might be, Inez could not hate Mildred after this.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I do not wish to drive you away,” she asserted
in a positive voice. “I will not tell your
secret.”</p>
<p class="pnext">For a time Mildred mused silently, as if considering
how to begin.</p>
<p class="pnext">“My mother died when I was a baby,” said
she. “She was a Travers and lived on a ranch
near here.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I know the Travers Ranch,” said Inez quickly.
“But no Travers have live there in a long time.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“My mother lived there,” continued Mildred,
“until she married my father. Indeed, she lived
there several years after, for I was born in the
ranch house. But my mother’s people—the
Traverses—did not like my father, and when
mother died he took me away to a house in
Escondido. I think he was sent away, and the
family sold the ranch and went back to England,
where they had originally come from.</p>
<p class="pnext">“In Escondido an old Mexican woman kept
house for us. She was named Izbel.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Ah!” cried Inez, nodding her head wisely;
“I know.” Then, as Mildred looked at her questioningly,
she added: “Go on.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“My father was away from home much of the
time. He traveled, and sometimes he took me
with him into Mexico, and we went as far south
as Matanzas, and once to Mexico City. That
was when I was quite small, and I do not remember
much about it. But often we came here to
visit Señor Cristoval, with whom he had some
secret business. I have seen him give my father
big bags of golden coins, although everyone said
he was a miser. I remember that at one time
my father hid in this very wall for a day and a
night, and officers came to the house and searched
it, saying they were looking for a smuggler and
had traced him here.</p>
<p class="pnext">“But Señor Cristoval laughed at them and
told them to examine the house thoroughly. This
they did, and went away satisfied. Afterward
my father came out of the wall and took me
across the country to San Bernardino, where we
stayed at a friend’s house for several days.
Finally Señor Cristoval came there to visit us
and I heard him tell my father it would not be
safe for him to return home and advised him
to go far away. He also gave my father much
money, and one curious thing which he said to
him I never forgot. ‘I will keep your fortune
safely until you need it,’ was his remark. ‘I
will hide it where no one will ever find it, any
more than they could find you.’”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Ah! then he hid your father’s fortune in
this place?” cried Inez eagerly. Then her face
fell. “But, no,” she added. “We have look,
and there is no fortune here.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred sighed and continued her tale.</p>
<p class="pnext">“After this Señor Cristoval shook my father’s
hand, and kissed me—for he was always fond
of me—and went away. I never saw him again.
My father and I traveled to New York and as
I was then eleven years of age I became much
troubled over our exile and begged to be told why
it was not safe for us to stay in California. He explained
to me that he had purchased laces and
other goods in Mexico and brought them into the
United States secretly, without paying the duty
which the robbing government officials imposed.
For that he said he was liable to be arrested
and put in prison, and if I ever allowed the
secret to escape me I would be the means of
ruining him. I was a very sensitive child, and
the importance of this great secret weighed upon
me heavily. My father declared he had done
no wrong, but I knew that the officers of the
law were constantly searching for him and it
so crushed me and destroyed my happiness that
at twelve years of age I was as nervous, as
suspicious and evasive as any old woman could
be.”</p>
<p class="pnext">She paused and gave a little shudder. Said
Inez, who had listened intently:</p>
<p class="pnext">“I know now who you are. Your name is
Mildred Leighton.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You know that!” cried Mildred, amazed.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Of course I know that, when I know your
father was the great smuggler that the officers
never could catch. I am told many stories about
Leighton the smuggler, and old Izbel, who kept
his house, is my aunt. Old Izbel say Señor
Cristoval give Leighton the money to buy with,
and Leighton give Señor Cristoval, who love
money so much, half of all he make. But no
one could ever prove that. Leighton was very
clever man. No one could ever catch him.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Inez spoke admiringly, as if Mildred’s father
was a hero and Mildred had gained added prestige
by being his daughter. But the other girl
frowned and continued her story.</p>
<p class="pnext">“In New York,” she said, “we lived in a
boarding house and I was sent to school. My
father was not kind to me any more. He grew
cross and gloomy and often would say if I told
his secret he would kill me. I did not tell; I
kept the secret safe locked in my heart and
suffered agonies of apprehension for his sake,
for I still loved him fondly. He now bought a
little ship and began to make sea voyages to and
from Cuba. He would not let me go with him
and he only swore when I tried to get him to
give up the wicked and dangerous life he was
leading. Often he denounced Cristoval, who had
in his possession valuable goods and money belonging
to my father but would not give them up
because he knew my father dared not go to
California to get them.</p>
<p class="pnext">“For years father continued to smuggle without
being suspected. Then one morning I received
a note asking me to come to the prison
to see him. They had caught him at last and
seized his ship, and he said there had been a
fight in which several of the government agents
had been shot, and one killed. My father did not
shoot, he told me, but they would blame him for
everything.</p>
<p class="pnext">“He stayed in the prison for a month, and
every day I went to see him. Then came the
trial and he was sentenced to prison for life.
They—they proved that he ordered his men to
shoot,” she added, lowering her head as if
ashamed.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well, that was right,” maintained Inez,
cheerfully. “If they try to arrest him, Leighton
was right to shoot.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“No, Inez, he was very wrong,” replied Mildred
sadly. “I would never be allowed to see
my father after he was taken away, so they let
us talk for the last time. He told me they had
taken away all his money and he had nothing to
give me, but that if I could manage to get to
California old Señor Cristoval owed him much
money and—and other things, and perhaps he
would give it to me, although he had refused
to give it to my father. Afterward they took
him away to Sing Sing prison, and that was the
last I ever saw of him, for a year later he died.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I do not suppose, Inez, any girl was ever
left with such a heritage of shame and trouble.
You think me hard and cold; but can you blame
me? Always I think some one will discover
my secret, that they will say I am the daughter
of Leighton the smuggler and point the finger
of shame at me.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I was a friendless girl with no money. The
people at the boarding house would not let me
remain and I took my little bundle and wandered
out into the street in search of home and employment.
It was then that a kind lady, a Mrs.
Runyon, had pity on me and put me into a
school for nurses. I was fifteen years old and
big and strong for my age. At seventeen I was
nursing in a charity hospital, but my father’s
disgrace had made me an outcast and prevented
my obtaining situations with good families. Mrs.
Runyon tried to help me but my story was too
well known. I changed my name from Leighton
to Travers, but even that did not bring me better
luck.</p>
<p class="pnext">“For two years longer I worked for a bare
pittance, and then suddenly a ray of sunshine
appeared. Miss De Graf came to the hospital
where I was caring for an injured child and
offered me a position with her cousin out here
in California, where I had known the happiest
days of my life. More than that, I found to my
joy that I was coming directly to the old Cristoval
house, for although Señor Cristoval was
long since dead—as I had found out by writing
him—I remembered the secret rooms and hoped
I might find at least a part of my father’s fortune
still hidden there.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well,” she added after a pause, “these are
the rooms, and there is nothing of value left
in them; this is the old Cristoval home, where
my father was forced to hide from the law; this
is the country where the officers hounded the
hated smuggler like a dog and finally drove him
away. And here is the girl, Inez, who has
passed through all these scenes and to-day finds
nothing in life worth living for.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Inez took her hand, shyly but tenderly.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Meeldred,” she said softly, “perhaps your
life will end here. It will be strange, will it not,
if that is so? But if we cannot get out, it makes
a good story to die in this old den of the smuggler,
your father. I will die with you; but I do
not mind—much. But Mees Jane—”</p>
<p class="pnext">She broke off with a wail of anguish and
Mildred said hastily:</p>
<p class="pnext">“Inez, we must save the baby! And, if we
do, we shall also save ourselves. Come; you,
at least, have much to live for. You will care
for the baby after I have gone far away, and
you will be glad, then, that the hated Mildred
is out of your life.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But I do not hate you any more!” cried the
Mexican girl protestingly. “I like you now,
Meeldred. We will be friends, an’ we will be
happy together, if—if—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“If what, Inez?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“If we live to get out of this wall.”</p>
</div>
<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-xvian-unexpected-arrival">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id17">CHAPTER XVI—AN UNEXPECTED ARRIVAL</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">As the night advanced the two girls continued
to talk, in low and subdued voices because of
their anxiety and growing fears. They kept the
candles trimmed, for the light lent them courage.
They were not hungry, although they had eaten
nothing since noon, but they were beginning to
suffer from thirst.</p>
<p class="pnext">The baby wakened with shrill screams and the
only way to quiet her was to give her the bottle,
which was now less than a third full. Mildred was
in a quandary whether to withhold the remainder
of the food from little Jane, so as to prolong
her life as much as possible, or to allow the
baby to eat what she desired, as long as any of
the food remained. She finally decided on the
latter course, hoping the morning would bring
some one to their rescue.</p>
<p class="pnext">After the little one was again hushed in slumber
and cuddled in warm blankets on a seat beside
them, the two imprisoned girls renewed their
desultory conversation. They realized it must
be long after midnight but Mildred avoided looking
at her watch because that made the minutes
drag so slowly.</p>
<p class="pnext">Finally a dull sound from the other side of
the wall reached their ears. It seemed that some
one was pounding upon the adobe. Both girls
sprang to their feet in excitement, their heads
bent to listen. The pounding was not repeated
but a voice was heard—a far-away voice—as
of one calling.</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred answered the cry, at the top of her
lungs, and immediately Inez followed with a
shrill scream that roused a thousand echoes in the
hidden passage. And now Toodlums joined the
chorus, startled from her sleep and terrified by
the riot of sound.</p>
<p class="pnext">They tried to listen, but the baby’s cries prevented
anything else from being heard, so they
devoted themselves to quieting little Jane. It
took some time to do this, for the sobbing infant
was thoroughly frightened, but finally Inez succeeded
in comforting her and the bottle of
precious milk was sacrificed to put baby to sleep
again.</p>
<p class="pnext">By this time the sounds on the other side of
the wall had ceased; but the girls were now full
of eager hope, believing they had succeeded in
letting their friends know they were imprisoned
in the wall.</p>
<p class="pnext">Within the hour more dull pounding began and
this continued so regularly that Mildred told Inez
the rescuers were surely trying to break through
the adobe. They listened alertly to each blow and
for a time forgot both thirst and fatigue in the
excitement of the moment. Daybreak was near,
for already a gray light was creeping in through
the gratings overhead.</p>
<p class="pnext">Suddenly a crash like a thunder-clap resounded
from the end of the passage. From the gloomy
recess behind the couch a man’s form appeared,
struck the bed, was rebounded by the springs
into the air, turned a complete somersault and
landed on the floor of the passage in a sitting
position, facing the two startled nurses.</p>
<p class="pnext">He did not seem to be hurt, but was evidently
bewildered. He glared in amazement at the girls
and they glared in amazement at him. Then,
slowly, he turned his eyes to view his surroundings
and blinked stupidly at the candles, the
antique carved furniture, the baby bundled upon
a cushioned seat and finally rested his eyes again
upon the faces of the nurses.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Why, it is Señor Bul-Run!” cried Inez, clapping
her hands with joy. “He have come to
save us.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Pardon me,” said the man, in a rather
quavering falsetto, “I’m not sure whether I’ve
come to save you or to share your peril. Where
am I, please?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“It is the hollow of the wall, sir,” replied
Mildred, who had never seen the big fellow before.
“It is the secret apartment constructed by
Señor Cristoval, who built this house.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well,” said he, slowly getting upon his feet
and with another curious glance around, “I can’t
say that I consider it a desirable place of residence.
Certainly it’s no place for our precious
Toodlums,” and he bent over the sleeping babe
and tenderly kissed its forehead. Then, straightening
up, he said in as determined a tone as his
high voice would permit: “We must find a way
to get out of here!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Can’t you get out the same way you got
in?” asked Mildred.</p>
<p class="pnext">He looked at her in perplexed astonishment.</p>
<p class="pnext">“How did I get in?” he inquired.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Don’t you know?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’ve no idea. I was sitting in the window of
the blue room, resting, when there was a bang,
whirligig, fireworks—and here I am, your uninvited
guest.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“The blue room!” cried Mildred.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes. Did you happen to notice my arrival?
I don’t mean its lack of dignity, but the direction
I came from?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You came from somewhere behind that bed.
I saw you strike the mattress and—and bound
up again.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“To be sure. I remember bounding up again.
I—I didn’t care to stop, you see. I was anxious
to—to—see if baby Jane was all right.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred could not repress a smile, while Inez
giggled openly.</p>
<p class="pnext">“However,” continued the big man, good-humoredly,
“the direction affords us a clew.
Pardon my absence for a moment while I investigate.”</p>
<p class="pnext">He took one of the candles, cautiously made
his way over the couch and stood upon the oak
chest at the end of the narrow chamber. Here
he was able to examine the heavy planking set in
the adobe, through which he had doubtless made
his appearance but which now appeared as solid
and immovable as the wall itself.</p>
<p class="pnext">Runyon’s first act was to pass the light of the
candle carefully over every joint and edge, with
the idea of discovering a spring or hinge. But
no such thing seemed to exist. Then he took out
his big jackknife and began prying. When a
blade snapped he opened another, only to break it
in his vain twisting and jabbing. Finally he
threw the now useless knife from him and began
pounding with his fists upon the planking, at
the same time shouting with the best voice he
could muster. Perhaps the pounding might have
been heard had not his friends at that moment
been seeking for his mangled form in the garden,
among the rose vines.</p>
<p class="pnext">After listening in vain for a reply, Runyon
came back to the girls, saying:</p>
<p class="pnext">“This is certainly a singular occurrence. I
came in as easily as I ever did anything in my
life, I assure you; but the way out is not so easy.
However, we won’t have to endure this confinement
long, for the boys are breaking down the
wall in two places.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Then, in reply to their anxious questioning,
he related the incidents of the night: how the
discovery was made that Toodlums and her two
nurses were missing; of the search throughout
the country in automobiles; how the major had
heard the “ghost” of baby Jane, which had
given them their first intimation of the truth, and
of the desperate and vain attempts made to get
into the secret chamber.</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred, in return, explained the accident that
had led to their imprisonment and of their failure
to find any means of escape.</p>
<p class="pnext">“There must be a way out, of course,” she
added, “for Señor Cristoval would never invent
such clever and complicated ways of getting into
this hollow wall without inventing other means
of getting out.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“True enough,” agreed Runyon; “but I can’t
see why he thought it necessary to make the
means of getting <em class="italics">out</em> a secret. These rooms were
probably built as hiding-places, and there are at
least two separate entrances. But whoever hid
here should be master of the situation and have
no difficulty in escaping when the danger was
over.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Unless,” said Mildred, thoughtfully, “the
rooms were also intended as a prison.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well, perhaps that is it,” said the man. “Old
Cristoval may have thought the occasion would
arise when he would like to keep one or more
prisoners here, so he concealed the exits as carefully
as the entrances. Let us admit, young
ladies, that it’s a first-class prison. But,” his
tone changing to one of kindly concern, “how
have you stood this ordeal? You must be worn
out with anxiety, and desperately hungry, too.”</p>
<p class="pnext">As he gazed into Mildred’s face it occurred to
him, for the first time, that Jane’s new nurse
was an interesting girl. She was not exactly
beautiful, but—attractive. Indeed, at that moment
Mildred was at her best, despite the night’s
vigil. The hard, defiant look had left her eyes
for the first time in years, driven out by a train
of exciting events that had led her to forget herself
and her rebellion against fate, at least for
the time being.</p>
<p class="pnext">“We are not very hungry,” she said, smiling
at the big, boyish rancher, “but we are thirsty.
I’d give anything for a good drink of water.
And baby is now devouring the last few drops
of her prepared food. When it is gone there is
nothing here that she can eat.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well,” said he, spurred to action by this
report, “I’m going to explore this place carefully,
for if we can manage to find a way out it
will save Weldon and his men from ruining that
wall, and also save time, for the blamed adobe
is so hard and thick that it will still require hours
for them to make a hole big enough to get
us out.”</p>
</div>
<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-xviithe-prodigal-son">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id18">CHAPTER XVII—THE PRODIGAL SON</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">With the added light that now came from the
gratings in the ceiling every object in the upper
room was plainly visible. Runyon began his
inspection in a methodical manner, starting at
one corner and eyeing the inner wall on every
inch of its surface. He tested each block at its
corners and edges. The girls watched him listlessly,
for they expected no result, having covered
the same methods themselves.</p>
<p class="pnext">At length Runyon was obliged to abandon the
wall in despair.</p>
<p class="pnext">“The opening is there, of course,” he said, “but
that confounded Cristoval was too clever for us.
If I had the rascal here now, I’d strangle him!”</p>
<p class="pnext">As he stood in the center of the narrow space,
looking around him, his eye fell upon the upholstered
seats ranged along one side and he regarded
them suspiciously. They were box-like
affairs, with the surface of the covers padded and
cushioned.</p>
<p class="pnext">He reached down and lifted one of the lids.
As he glanced within he uttered an exclamation
of astonishment. The box was almost filled with
bottles, lying regularly on their sides.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Wine!” he cried. “Now, Miss—I don’t
remember to have heard your name—I shall be
able to relieve your thirst.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“My name is Travers—Mildred Travers,
sir; but I can’t drink wine.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Not to quench your thirst—just a few
swallows?” he asked, taking a bottle and trying
to remove the cork.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Not a drop, even to save my life,” she replied
positively.</p>
<p class="pnext">“But I will, Señor Runyon—I will!” cried
Inez eagerly.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Runyon!” exclaimed Mildred, stepping back
in amazement and looking at the man rather
wildly.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Excuse me; haven’t I introduced myself?”
he asked, looking up. “Yes; my name’s
Runyon.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Something in her expression arrested his gaze
and he regarded the girl curiously.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Bulwer Runyon?” she said in a low voice.</p>
<p class="pnext">He sat down on the box, holding the bottle
between his knees.</p>
<p class="pnext">“They christened me that. Very foolishly, I
think. But what do you know of Bulwer
Runyon?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Your mother—is—Martha Runyon?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“To be sure—bless her heart! Ah, you know
my mother, then, and that’s how you have heard
of me. But nothing good, from the dear old
lady’s lips, I’ll be bound.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“She really loves you,” replied Mildred quickly;
“only—you have disappointed her.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Indeed I have. I’ve always disappointed her,
ever since I can remember.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You were very extravagant,” said Mildred in
a reproachful tone.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes; that was my fault. Father spoiled me;
then he died and left all his fortune to mother.
Quite right. But mother is pretty close with
her money.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Did she not pay all your debts?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes; but that was foolish. She reproached
me for owing people, which was one of my pet
recreations. So she paid the bills, bought me
a ranch out here, shipped me into exile and
washed her hands of me, declaring that the ranch
was my sole inheritance and I must never expect
another cent of her fortune. She proposes, I
believe, to invest her surplus in charity. Nice
idea, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“It was very generous in her,” declared
Mildred.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Was it? Well, that’s a matter of opinion.
But I regard her gift of this ranch as the first
step to perpetual pauperdom. She tossed the
land at me, shuffled me off, and then expected me
to make a living.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Can’t you do that?” asked Mildred
wonderingly.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Make a living on a California ranch!” he
said, as if astonished.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Others do,” she asserted.</p>
<p class="pnext">“There is no other just like your humble servant,”
he assured her, again struggling with the
cork. “I can’t grow enough lemons—it’s a
lemon ranch she handed me—to pay expenses.
The first year I decorated my estate with a mortgage;
had to have an automobile, you know. The
second year I put another plaster on to pay the
interest of the first mortgage and a few scattering
debts. Third year, the third patch; fourth
year, the usual thing. Fifth year—that’s this
one—the money sharks balked. They said the
ranch is loaded to its full capacity. So, I’ll have
to sell some lemons.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, I’m so sorry!” cried Mildred.</p>
<p class="pnext">“So am I, thank you. Stupid thing, selling
lemons. But the wolf’s at the door and all I can
do is shoot lemons at the brute. Lemons!
Wasn’t it tart of the dear mother to load me with
such an acidulous estate? Perhaps she imagined
it would make me assiduous—eh?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Your mother hoped you would turn over
a new leaf and—and redeem your past,” said
the girl.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well, it’s too late to do that now. I can’t
redeem the past without redeeming the ranch,
and that’s impossible,” he declared with a grin.
“But tell me, please, how you happen to be so
deep in my mother’s confidence.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred hesitated, but reflected that she really
owed him an explanation.</p>
<p class="pnext">“She protected me when I was in trouble,”
she said softly.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Ah; that’s like the dear old girl. Do you
know, I’ve an idea that when I’m down and out
she’ll relent and come to my assistance with a
fatted calf? It would be just like her. I’ve
known of others she befriended. Her hobby is
to help poor girls. There was that Leighton girl,
for instance, whose smuggling, murderous father
was imprisoned for life. The poor little thing
hadn’t a friend in the world till mother took her
in hand and put her in a training school for
nurses. The mother wrote me how interested she
was in that case. Her protege did her credit,
it seems, for the child turned out a very good
nurse, who—who—”</p>
<p class="pnext">He suddenly paused, flushed red and stared at
the girl uncertainly.</p>
<p class="pnext">“You say your name is—Travers?” he
asked.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes,” she replied, casting down her eyes.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Not—Leighton?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Cannot you pull the cork, Señor Runyon?
I am so thirsty!” cried Inez quickly, to save her
friend from disclosing her secret. But big Runyon
was bright enough, in spite of his peculiarities.
He read Mildred’s confusion and suspected
the truth, but was too considerate to press the
question.</p>
<p class="pnext">“The cork is obstinate,” said he; “so we won’t
argue with the thing,” and he struck the neck of
the bottle against a corner of the seat and broke
it so neatly that not a drop of the contents was
spilled. Then he took a cup from the shelf and
poured out some of the wine.</p>
<p class="pnext">“It’s a native vintage,” said he, “but it ought
to be mellow and mild after all the years it has
lain here.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Inez drank. The California Mexicans are accustomed
to the native wines and consume them
as freely as water. But Mildred, although again
pressed to quench her thirst, steadfastly refused.</p>
<p class="pnext">Runyon took a little of the wine, for he also
was thirsty, and then he made an examination
of the other seats. Some contained more wine;
others were quite empty; but no water was discovered
anywhere.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Now I shall go below,” said Runyon, “and
see if I can unearth anything of importance there.
Do you hear those dull sounds on the other side
of the wall? They tell us that our friends are
busy drilling the holes. It’s wonderful how tough
that adobe is.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Little Jane had awakened again and Inez took
baby Jane in her arms and, with Mildred, followed
Runyon down the stairs into the lower
chamber. Here they watched his careful inspection
of the room but did not hope for any favorable
result.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Here is food,” he announced, as, having given
up the idea of finding egress, he came upon the
cans of tomatoes and corn.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes; but we have no can-opener,” replied
Mildred; “and, unless the contents were cooked,
they would not be eatable.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’m not thinking of the eatables,” said Runyon,
taking out a small pen-knife, for he had
already ruined the larger one he always carried.
“Tomatoes usually have a lot of liquid in the
cans, a sort of watery juice which I am sure
would help to relieve your thirst.”</p>
<p class="pnext">He began prying at the tin with a knife blade,
but it was a heavy quality of plate, such as is
rarely used nowadays, and resisted his attempt.
Soon the blade of the frail tool snapped at the
handle, and he tried the other blade. That, too,
soon broke and Runyon regarded the can with a
sort of wonder.</p>
<p class="pnext">“It beats me,” he said, shaking his head.
“But I don’t like to give up, and that tomato-juice
would be of service if we could only get
at it.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Looking around for another implement his eye
spied the revolver hanging upon its peg.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Ah! if that weapon is loaded I’ll use a bullet
as a can-opener,” he exclaimed, and reaching up
he removed the revolver from its place.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Good; six cartridges, 32 caliber,” said he.
“Now, young ladies, if you can stand the noise,
and the powder hasn’t spoiled, I believe I can
make a hole in that can which will allow the
juice to run out.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I don’t care,” said Inez, “but I will take
Mees Jane upstairs, first.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“The sound will echo like a regular battle,”
said Mildred; “but as I am really thirsty and
your suggestion of relief tempts me, I am willing
to have you shoot the pistol.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Runyon placed the can upon the edge of the
low hinged table, where it stood about waist
high. When Inez had gone above with little
Jane, the man took a position whereby he faced
obliquely the outer wall and aiming at the tomatoes
said:</p>
<p class="pnext">“Better stop up your ears, Miss—Mildred.”</p>
<p class="pnext">She obeyed and he fired.</p>
<p class="pnext">Even their anticipations could not prepare them
for the wild riot of sound that followed the explosion.
The bullet found its mark, for the can
toppled and fell from the shelf and lay spilling
its contents upon the floor. The bullet went
farther and struck a crevice of the outer wall.
A cloud of smoke for a moment obscured their
view and Mildred, regarding the tomato-can,
cried out:</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, pick it up! Pick it up, quick! It is
spilling.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Runyon made no reply. He was staring
straight ahead, in a dazed, bewildered way, and
now Mildred’s eyes followed his.</p>
<p class="pnext">The smoke was rolling out of a large aperture
in the outer wall. Three huge blocks of adobe,
neatly joined together, had swung outward,
moved by a secret spring which the bullet
had released.</p>
<p class="pnext">Through the grim prison wall they were looking
out at the sunshine that flooded the rose
garden.</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred sank to her knees, sobbing with joy.
Big Runyon walked to the staircase.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Hi, there, Inez!” he called. “Come down
here and take Toodlums to her mother. I’ll bet a
button she’ll be jolly glad to see that kid again!”</p>

<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id19">CHAPTER XVIII—LACES AND GOLD</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">At four o’clock in the afternoon Patsy rubbed
her eyes, yawned and raised her head from her
pillow.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Dear me!” she sighed, “I’m tired yet, but
this sleeping in the daytime is unnatural. I wonder
if Beth is awake.”</p>
<p class="pnext">She went to the door of the adjoining room,
opened it and found her cousin dressing.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Do you suppose anyone else is up?” she
inquired.</p>
<p class="pnext">“See there,” replied Beth, pointing through
the window.</p>
<p class="pnext">Patsy saw. Mr. Runyon was seated on a
garden bench in earnest conversation with Mildred
Travers.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Didn’t he go home this morning, after the
excitement was over?” she asked.</p>
<p class="pnext">“No,” replied Beth. “Mr. and Mrs. Hahn
drove their car home, but our interesting neighbor
at the north, Mr. Bul Run, declared there
was nothing at his own ranch half so enticing as
a bed here. He’s a bachelor, it seems, and leads
rather a lonely life. So Arthur gave him a
room and he went to bed; but it seems he has
had his sleep out and is indulging in other recreations.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Patsy was eyeing the couple in the garden.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Mr. Runyon seems to have struck up a friendship
with your protégé Mildred,” she observed.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes,” answered Beth. “You know he was
shut up in the wall with her and Inez for awhile
and the adventure must have made them feel well
acquainted. Wasn’t that imprisonment a most
peculiar thing, Patsy?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Very peculiar. I haven’t had much time to
think about it, for as soon as Toodlums was
safe in Louise’s arms I went to bed. But it
occurs to me to wonder how Mildred Travers
knew so much of the secrets of this absurd old
house and why she ventured to explore the hidden
rooms in our absence. Put that with the
fact that she lived in these parts as a girl, and
with her eagerness to come out here—don’t
you remember her fervent ‘thank heaven’?—and
it seems the whole mystery isn’t unraveled
yet; it’s only getting more tangled.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Beth was thoughtful for a time.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I am sure Mildred will have some explanation
to make,” she said presently. “Don’t let us
judge her just yet, Patsy. And I advise you to
get dressed, for there’s Louise wheeling the baby,
and perhaps everyone else is downstairs but us.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Louise and baby both slept all through that
awful night,” remarked Patsy, again yawning.
“No wonder they’re up and around and looking
bright and happy.” But she took her cousin’s
hint and dressed so rapidly that she descended the
stairs only a few moments after Beth did.</p>
<p class="pnext">Uncle John, the major and Arthur were in
the court, smoking and sipping coffee. The
events of the past night were still being earnestly
discussed by them and much speculation was indulged
in concerning the rooms in the hollow wall
and the uses to which they had been put during
the pioneer days when Cristoval constructed them,
and even afterward when his son, the last owner,
had occupied the premises.</p>
<p class="pnext">“The entire ranch,” said Arthur, “as well as
this house, was sold by the executors appointed
by the court, for it seems that Cristoval had no
heirs in this country. The money was sent over
to Spain and divided among a host of relations,
the executors were discharged, and that ended
the matter as far as the law is concerned. But I
am sure the secret of the wall was at that time
unknown to any, for otherwise the furniture in
those narrow rooms, some of which is expensive
and valuable on account of its unique carving,
and the bins of wine and other truck, would
have been sold with the other ‘personal possessions.’
I bought this place of a man who had
purchased it at the executors’ sale but never has
lived in it. All the rooms were stripped bare,
which goes to prove that the hidden recesses in
the walls were unknown. Now, the question is,
do I legally own the contents of that wall, or
don’t I?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I stepped into the rooms, this morning, with
the others, but merely glanced around a bit,”
said Mr. Merrick. “I’ve an idea you may rightfully
claim whatever is there. The value of such
old, odd pieces is arbitrary and they wouldn’t
total enough at an auction sale to bother about.
My idea, Arthur, is that you remove whatever
you care to retain, stop up the rat holes, and then
seal up the place forever.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I suppose,” remarked the major, “those hollow
places in the wall were of real value in the
days of wild Indians and murdering highwaymen.
But, as John Merrick says, they’re of no use to
anyone now, but rather a source of danger.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Was that door left open?” asked Patsy.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes; and I put a brace against it, so it
couldn’t close and shut us out,” replied Arthur.</p>
<p class="pnext">“That doesn’t matter; Mildred knows the way
in,” said Beth. “The whole trouble was that
Inez closed the door behind them and they
couldn’t manage to get out again.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Mr. Merrick sipped his coffee reflectively.</p>
<p class="pnext">“That girl,” said he, “ought to explain how
she knows so much—and so little.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“And what she was doing in the secret rooms,”
added the major.</p>
<p class="pnext">“She’ll do that,” piped a high voice, and in
sauntered Mr. Runyon and sat down to pour himself
some coffee. “I’ve just left Miss—er—er—Travers,
and she has decided to tell you all
her whole story, frankly and without reservation,
and then she wants to ask your advice.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Whose advice?” demanded Arthur.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Everybody’s advice. She asked mine, a little
while ago, and I told her to put it up to the
crowd. The poor thing has had a sad history and
there’s a bit of romance and tragedy connected
with it; but she has been quite blameless. I
haven’t known you people long, but I’ll bank on
your generosity and fairness, and that’s what I
told the poor girl.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Where is she now?” asked Patsy.</p>
<p class="pnext">“In the garden with Mrs. Weldon and
Toodlums. They’ll all be here presently.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The little group remained silent and thoughtful
until Louise entered wheeling the baby in her
cab and followed by Mildred Travers. The
nurse’s face was white and troubled but she had
acquired a new attractiveness for the reason that
her eyes had softened and were now pleading
instead of defiant.</p>
<p class="pnext">Inez came running from the nursery to take
baby, but Louise would not let little Jane go.
Although she had escaped much of the past night’s
misery, thanks to Dr. Knox’s quieting powders,
the young mother was still unnerved and liked
to have the child where she could see it. So
Inez sat on a bench and held Jane, who was
the least concerned of anyone over her recent
peril and fortunate escape.</p>
<p class="pnext">The court was shady, cool and quiet. Those
assembled eyed Mildred curiously and expectantly,
so that she was really embarrassed at first.
Beth, who felt in a measure responsible for this
waif of a great city, because she had been instrumental
in bringing her here, gently led Mildred
to a beginning of her story by asking a few
questions that afforded the girl an opening.</p>
<p class="pnext">The entire party listened gravely to the recital,
for only Inez, among those present, had ever
heard any part of the strange tale before.</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred told practically the same story she
had related to the Mexican girl the night before,
but went more into details and explained more
fully her girlhood acquaintance with Señor
Cristoval.</p>
<p class="pnext">“He was an unusual man,” said she; “aged
and white-haired, as I remember him, and always
dressed in white flannels, which threw his dark
skin into sharp relief. He lived alone in the
house, having but one man-servant to do all the
work, cook his meals and cater to his slightest
whim.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Miguel Zaloa,” said Inez in a low voice.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Cristoval was not popular,” said Mildred,
“for he loved money so well that he was reputed
to be a miser. It was this love of money, I think,
that induced him to go into partnership with my
father in his illegal smuggling enterprises. Cristoval
furnished the money and when my father
had slipped across the border with his bales of
rare laces, they were hidden in the hollow wall
until they could be forwarded to San Francisco
and sold.</p>
<p class="pnext">“And this brings me to a relation of my present
interest in this house,” she continued. “When
we escaped from California a large lot of very
valuable Mexican laces which belonged exclusively
to my father was hidden in the wall. The
sale of a former lot of smuggled goods had resulted
in a large profit and Cristoval had received
a bank draft for the amount, one half of which
was due my father. When we last saw Cristoval
at San Bernardino, before we left for New York,
he promised my father to cash the draft and send
him the proceeds. This he never did, although
he advanced my father, at that time, a sum of
money from other sources to pay our expenses
until we could establish ourselves in the east.</p>
<p class="pnext">“To avoid suspicion, my father always allowed
Cristoval to bank the partnership money, drawing
on the rich Spaniard from time to time for
what he required. Father told me that altogether
Cristoval owed him nine thousand dollars, besides
the bale of laces, valued at ten thousand more.
He wrote many times to demand this money,
using a cipher they had arranged between them,
but his letters were never answered. I know
now that Cristoval died soon after we went to
New York, so whoever got the letters, being unable
to read the secret cipher, of course ignored
them.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Just as Leighton was being taken to prison,
the last time I ever saw him, he told me to find
some way to come here and get the money. He
said that if Cristoval was dead, as he then
suspected, the secret of the wall was still safe,
for the old man had vowed never to disclose it.
He thought I would find the laces still hidden
in the wall, and perhaps the money.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Did you look to see, while you were there?”
asked Arthur Weldon.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes. There is no evidence of any property
that I could rightfully claim.”</p>
<p class="pnext">It was a strange recital, and a fascinating one
to those who heard it.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Who would think,” said Patsy, “that in this
prosaic age we would get so close to a real story
of smuggling, hidden treasure and secret recesses
in walls? It smacks more of the romantic days
of past centuries.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“We must not forget,” replied Louise, “that
of all our numerous states California has the
most romantic history. It wasn’t so long ago that
the Spanish don flourished in this section and
even yet it is more Spanish than American except
in the big cities.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“As for smuggling,” added Runyon, “that is
going on to-day—as merrily as in the days of
the famous Leighton, if on a smaller scale. I’ve
some choice cigars over at my ranch that have
never paid duty, and I’ve an order with the
smuggler for more. So, after all, there’s nothing
very astonishing in Mildred Leighton’s story.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“The wall we have practical evidence of,”
said Uncle John. “I suppose it will hold its
secret rooms for many years to come, for these
adobe dwellings are practically fire-proof and are
built to defy time.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But about Mildred’s fortune,” cried Patsy.
“Don’t you suppose it is hidden, after all, some
place in the wall?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“From what I have heard of Cristoval,” said
Arthur in a reflective tone, “he was not considered
a dishonest man, but rather miserly and
grasping.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“My father,” explained Mildred, “trusted him
fully until we went away and could get no answer to
his letters. The old Spaniard was very
fond of me, also, and he would hold me in his
arms and say that one day I would be a rich
lady, for my father and he were both making my
fortune. I was very young, as you know, but
I never forgot that statement.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Suppose,” suggested the major, “we make
another and more thorough search of those secret
rooms.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“We will do that,” replied Arthur promptly.
“It is too late to undertake the task to-night, but
we will begin it right after breakfast to-morrow
morning. Inez, I wish you would slip down to
the quarters and ask Miguel to come and help us.
Tell him to be here at nine o’clock.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The girl nodded, gave the baby to Mildred
and stole quietly out of the court.</p>

<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-xixinez-and-miguel">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id20">CHAPTER XIX—INEZ AND MIGUEL</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">Inez found Miguel Zaloa smoking his cigarette
among the orange trees. He was quite alone and
looked at the girl in an expectant way as she
approached.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, Miguel!” she cried. “I tell you a secret.
Of course it is no secret any more, for now they
all know it, up there at the house. Meeldred
Travers, the girl from New York, is not Meeldred
Travers. She is the child of Leighton the
smuggler—she is Meeldred Leighton!”</p>
<p class="pnext">The old ranchero stood as if turned to stone,
but he bit his cigarette in two and it fell unnoticed
upon the ground. While Inez regarded him with
disappointment, because he had exhibited no
emotion at hearing the wonderful news, Miguel
turned his back and mechanically walked away
through a row of trees. A dozen paces distant
he halted and again stood motionless for the
space of a full minute. Then he swung around
and with slow, hesitating steps returned to Inez.</p>
<p class="pnext">“You say—she—ees Meeldred Leighton?”
he asked, as if he thought he had not heard
aright.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Of course. Don’t you remember, Miguel?
She say, when she used to come here, a little
girl, with Leighton the great smuggler, you did
know her. It was then you served Señor Cristoval,
at the big house.”</p>
<p class="pnext">He nodded, his dark eyes fixed upon her face
but displaying no expression.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Leighton is dead,” continued Inez, delighted
to be able to gossip of all she had heard. “They
put him in a prison an’ he died. So Meeldred
was ashame of her father’s bad name an’ call
herself Travers. She is poor, an’ that is why
she come here as nurse, so she can find the
money that belong to her.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Miguel suddenly seized her wrist in a powerful
grip.</p>
<p class="pnext">“What money?” he demanded.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Don’t; you hurt my arm! It is the money
Señor Cristoval owed her father. Take your
hand away, Miguel Zaloa!”</p>
<p class="pnext">Slowly he released her.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Where will she find thees money?” he asked.</p>
<p class="pnext">“She does not know. Perhaps it is not here
at all. But there was a great heap of laces, worth
much money, which Señor Cristoval hid in the
wall to keep for Leighton.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Miguel laughed. He seemed suddenly to have
regained his equanimity. He began rolling another
cigarette.</p>
<p class="pnext">“They will be old, by now, thees lace,” said he.</p>
<p class="pnext">“A lace is better when it is old,” asserted
the girl.</p>
<p class="pnext">The man paused, looked at the half-made cigarette
and tossed it away. Then he glanced around
to see if they were observed and taking Inez’
arm—gently, this time—he led her away from
the path and into a thicket of orange trees.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Thees Meeldred,” he said in soft tones, “you
hate.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“No, no! I do not hate her now. I love
Meeldred.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“So!” he said, drawing in his breath and regarding
the girl with surprise. “You tell me
once she is witch-woman.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I am wrong,” declared Inez earnestly. “She
is good. She have been poor an’ friendless, all
because of her father, the noble smuggler Leighton.
But see, Miguel; I have been all night shut
up in the wall with her. We talk, an’ I learn to
know her better. I do not hate Meeldred any
more—I love her!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Sit down,” said the old man, pointing to a
hillock beside a tree. Inez obeyed, and he squatted
on the ground facing her and coolly rolled
another cigarette. “Tell me more about thees
girl—Leighton’s girl,” he said.</p>
<p class="pnext">Inez related Mildred’s story as well as she was
able, exaggerating such romantic details as appealed
to her fancy, but showing unbounded sympathy
for her new friend. The aged ranchero
listened intently, nodding his white head now
and then to show his interest. When the girl
had finished he smoked for a time in silence.</p>
<p class="pnext">“What Meeldred do now?” he inquired.</p>
<p class="pnext">“They will hunt in the wall, to-morrow, to
find the lace,” she replied. “Meest Weldon say
for you to come to the house at nine o’clock, in
morning, to help them.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Meest Weld say that?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes. But we have search already—Meeldred
an’ me—an’ Meest Bul-Run have search,
an’ no lace is there. I am sure of that. I am
sure no money is there, too. So Meeldred mus’
stay as nurse all her life an’ help me take care
of Mees Jane.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Miguel pondered this.</p>
<p class="pnext">“B’m’by Mees Jane grow up,” said he. “What
can Leighton’s daughter do then?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“How can I tell that?” answered Inez, shaking
her head. “Always poor people mus’ work,
Miguel. Is it not so?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Rich people mus’ work, too,” continued the
Mexican girl dreamily, as she embraced her
drawn-up legs and rested her chin upon her knees.
“Was old Señor Cristoval more happy than we,
with all the money he loved? No! Meest Weldon
works; Meest Hahn works; even Meest Bul-Run
works—sometime. If one does not work,
one is not happy, Miguel; an’ if one mus’ work,
money makes not any difference. So, when Meeldred
find she is still poor, an’ has no money an’
no laces, like she hope for, she will work jus’
the same as ever, an’ be happy.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I, too, work,” remarked the old man. “I
have always work.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“If you had much money, Miguel, you would
still work.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You would not care for money; not you.
It would not do you any good. It would not
change your life.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“No.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Again they sat in silence, as if reflecting on this
primitive philosophy. Finally Inez said:</p>
<p class="pnext">“You remember Leighton, Miguel?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes. He was good man. He make much
money for Señor Cristoval an’ for heemself.
Sometime I see them count gold—ten pieces to
Señor Cristoval, ten pieces to Leighton—to
divide even. Then Leighton will throw me a
gold-piece an’ say: ‘That for you, Miguel, because
you are faithful an’ true.’”</p>
<p class="pnext">“An’ Señor Cristoval, did he throw the gold-piece
to you, also?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“No.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What did you do with the gold Leighton
give you, Miguel?”</p>
<p class="pnext">The old man shrugged his shoulders. “Tobacco.
Some wine. A game of card.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“An’ were you faithful an’ true, as Leighton
say?”</p>
<p class="pnext">He looked at her long and steadily.</p>
<p class="pnext">“What you theenk about that, Inez?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“When people talk about Miguel Zaloa, they
always say he is good man. I hear Meest Weldon
say: ‘Miguel is honest. I would trust Miguel
with all I have.’”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Meest Weld say that?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I think you are sometime honest, sometime
not; like I am myself,” replied the girl.</p>
<p class="pnext">The old man rose and led the way back to the
path.</p>
<p class="pnext">“To be always honest is to be sometime foolish,”
he muttered on the way. “Tell Meest
Weld I will be there, like he say, at nine o’clock.”</p>

<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-xxmr-runyons-discovery">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id21">CHAPTER XX—MR. RUNYON’S DISCOVERY</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">Sing Fing excelled himself at the dinner that
evening, which was a merry meal because all
dangers and worries seemed to belong to the
past. Also it was, as Uncle John feelingly remarked,
“the first square meal they had enjoyed
since the one at Castro’s restaurant.” Of course
Runyon stayed, because he was to help search
the wall the next day, and as the telephone had
been repaired Louise called up Rudolph and
Helen Hahn and begged them to drive over and
help them celebrate at the festive board.</p>
<p class="pnext">So the Hahns came—although they returned
home again in the late evening—and it was
really a joyous and happy occasion. Inez brought
in the baby, which crowed jubilantly and submitted
to so many kisses that Patsy declared she
was afraid they would wear the skin off Toodlum’s
chubby cheeks unless they desisted.</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred had gone to her room immediately
after her confession in the court and Louise had
respected her desire for privacy and had ordered
her dinner sent in to her.</p>
<p class="pnext">As they all sat in the library, after dining, in
a cosy circle around the grate fire, they conversed
seriously on Mildred Leighton and canvassed her
past history and future prospects.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I cannot see,” said Beth, always the nurse’s
champion, “that we are called upon to condemn
poor Mildred because her father was a criminal.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Of course not,” agreed Patsy, “the poor
child wasn’t to blame.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“These criminal tendencies,” remarked the
major gravely, “are sometimes hereditary.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, but that’s nonsense!” declared Uncle
John. “We can’t imagine Mildred’s becoming a
smuggler—or smuggleress, or whatever you call
it. That hard, cold look in her eyes, which we all
so thoughtlessly condemned, was merely an indication
of suffering, of hurt pride and shame for
the disgrace that had been thrust upon her. I
liked the girl better to-day, as with blazing cheeks
she told of all her grief and struggles, than ever
before since I knew her.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“The expression of the eye,” said Arthur, “is
usually considered an infallible indication of character.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“That’s a foolish prejudice,” asserted Patsy,
whose own frank and brilliant eyes were her
chief attraction.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I do not think so, dear,” objected Louise.
“The eyes may not truly indicate character, but
they surely indicate one’s state of mind. We did
not read the hard look in Mildred’s eyes correctly,
I admit, but it showed her to be on guard
against the world’s criticism, resentful of her
hard fate and hopeless in her longing for a respectable
social position. She realized that were
her story known she would meet with sneers and
jeers on every side, and therefore she proudly
held herself aloof.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But now,” said Patsy, “circumstances have
changed Mildred’s viewpoint. She found that
our knowledge of her story only brought her
sympathy and consideration, and when she left
us I noticed that her eyes were soft and grateful
and full of tears.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Big Runyon had listened to this conversation
rather uneasily and with evident disapproval.
Now he said, in as positive a tone as his unfortunate
voice would permit:</p>
<p class="pnext">“That girl’s a corker, and I’m proud of her.
In the first place, my mother is a shrewd judge of
character. You can’t fool her about a person’s
worth; just see how accurately she judged <em class="italics">my</em>
character! When the dear old lady—whose
only fault is being so close-fisted—picked up
Mildred Leighton and defended her, that act
vouched for the girl’s worth beyond dispute.
Mrs. Runyon—bless her stingy old heart!—never
makes a mistake. Just think of it: she
actually spent money in giving Mildred an education
as a trained nurse. To my mind that settled
the girl’s character for all time. Now, I don’t
care a continental whether she finds any smuggled
laces or not; she needs a friend, and now
that she is away from my mother’s care <em class="italics">I’m</em>
going to be that friend.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, Bul!” cried Louise with lively interest,
“are you in love?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Me? At my age? Cer-tain-ly not!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“How old are you?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Thirty.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Old enough to know better,” said Uncle John.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Old enough to need a wife to care for him,”
suggested Helen Hahn.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Honest Injun, Run; aren’t you a little soft
on Mildred?” asked Rudolph.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well, perhaps a little; but it’s nothing like
that currant-jelly, chocolate bonbon, glucose-like
feeling which I’ve observed is the outward demonstration
of love.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh, well; marry the girl and be done with it,
then,” laughed Arthur.</p>
<p class="pnext">“And rob me of my nurse?” protested Louise.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Runyon needs a nurse as much as Jane. In
fact, he’s a much bigger baby.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Mr. Runyon accepted all this jollying with
calm indifference.</p>
<p class="pnext">“The days of chivalry are over,” he sighed.
“If a fellow tries to protect a maiden in distress,
they think he wants to marry her.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Don’t you?” asked Patsy, in a sympathetic
tone.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Why, I hadn’t thought of it before; but it
wouldn’t be a half-bad idea,” he confessed.
“Ranch life is a bit lonely without women around
to bother one.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You are all talking foolishly,” observed Beth,
who was not romantic. “Mildred might object
to washing Mr. Runyon’s dishes.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Why, yes; I believe she would,” said Mr.
Runyon. “I’m sure she disapproves of my character;
that’s why I respect her judgment, so
highly. She didn’t seem at all interested in those
various mortgages, when I mentioned them; and
what else have I to offer a wife?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Even the cosy library could not hold them very
late, for none had been fully restored by the sleep
obtained during the day. Bed seemed more alluring
than a grate fire and when the Hahns went
home the party broke up, to meet again at an
eight o’clock breakfast.</p>
<p class="pnext">As soon as the meal was over Arthur Weldon
announced that the first business of the day
would be an examination of the secret rooms in
the wall of the old East Wing.</p>
<p class="pnext">“And this must be a thorough and final inspection
of the place,” he added. “We must satisfy
ourselves and Mildred Travers, without the shadow
of a doubt, that we have inventoried every
blessed thing in those rooms—even to the rats
and beetles.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“That’s right,” approved Mr. Merrick. “Let
us do the job once and for all. We’ve plenty
of time at our disposal and there are enough of
us with sharp eyes to ferret out every mystery of
the place. In Mildred’s interest we must be
thorough.”</p>
<p class="pnext">In the court they found old Miguel, sitting
motionless and patient. He was carefully dressed
in his best clothes and wore a red necktie, “just
as if,” said Patsy, “he was going to a party instead
of delving in dusty places.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The ranchero arose and made his master and
mistress one of his best bows. Then he waited
silently for instructions.</p>
<p class="pnext">Beth went to Mildred’s room and brought the
girl to join the searchers, for this undertaking
had been planned on her account. Her face wore
an anxious look, for although she was not very
hopeful of results it was the last chance of her
securing any of her father’s personal possessions.
Otherwise she greeted the party with modesty
and with gentle dignity and had never seemed to
them more womanly or agreeable.</p>
<p class="pnext">Together they left the court and proceeded to
the nursery. There were no laggards and everyone
except the servants was determined to have a
part in the fascinating investigation.</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred explained to them the manner in
which she had first entered the wall, putting in
action the secret method taught her as a girl by
Cristoval and demonstrating the mechanism before
their very eyes. They entered the lower
chamber, one by one, and this time the adobe
door was not closed behind them, although the
light of broad day now flooded the place through
the opening discovered by Runyon. This opening
led into the garden and was half choked with
rose vines. The series of swinging blocks had
been propped back against the outer wall to insure
a ready exit in case of accident.</p>
<p class="pnext">And now they eagerly set to work to pry into
every crack and corner of the place. The main
idea was to find some secret cavity or cupboard in
the wall which might contain the missing laces
or other valuables. With this in view they had
brought levers and pries and all sorts of tools
that might be of service.</p>
<p class="pnext">The girls were mainly useful in taking up and
turning the matting, now somewhat decayed by
age, and investigating those nooks and shelves
already discovered. But they found little more
than Mildred had done during her first exploration,
and the men who were testing the wall met
with no encouragement at all. Aside from the
two cleverly constructed openings—one into the
nursery and one into the garden—the blocks
which composed the wall seemed every one solid
and immovable and resisted every attempt to
wrest them from their places.</p>
<p class="pnext">After more than two hours of industry, during
which every man believed he had examined every
block, they were forced to abandon the lower
chamber and ascend the steep stairs to the upper
one.</p>
<p class="pnext">“This,” said Arthur, looking around him,
“seems far more promising. Let us give the
floor our first attention, for it is not over the
lower room but to one side of it. It strikes me
that the builder would be quite likely to make a
secret pocket in the floor.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Following this advice they attacked the blocks
of the floor with pry and crowbar, but found
nothing to reward them. Old Miguel worked
steadily and did whatever he was told, but displayed
no particle of enthusiasm, or even of interest.</p>
<p class="pnext">After the floor, the walls were examined, one
by one, from floor to ceiling. The panel on the
inner wall, which had baffled both Mildred and
Runyon on that eventful night of their imprisonment,
suddenly disclosed its secret when accidentally
pressed on opposite corners at the same
time. It slipped down and discovered a similar
panel beyond it, which was operated by a spring
placed in plain sight. Releasing this, they found
they were looking into the vacant second story
room which they had once before unsuccessfully
searched.</p>
<p class="pnext">So this was one way from the house into the
upper chamber of the wall. Of course there was
another way—that through which Runyon had
been so abruptly precipitated. In order to find
this the more readily, they sent the big rancher
into the blue room and asked him to take the
same position in the window he had on the night
of his disappearance. This he did, pushing
against the planking that boxed the window, with
both elbows and with his back and shoulders, but
without result. Finally, in his attempts, he inadvertently
struck the opposite panel with his heel,
and the response was startling. The panel, at his
back, being released, fell backward without
warning and for the second time Runyon tumbled
unawares into the chamber of the wall. As soon
as his body had fallen through, the panel slammed
into place again, urged by a very powerful steel
spring, but the major, who had been in the blue
room to watch Runyon, had caught the trick and
the mystery was solved.</p>
<p class="pnext">As for Mr. Runyon, he again fell upon the
bed and rebounded, knocking over both Mr. Merrick
and Miguel as he alighted in the narrow
chamber, but fortunately not injuring either of
them.</p>
<p class="pnext">A little dazed by his second precipitation, the
big rancher stared a moment and then slapped his
thigh a mighty stroke.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I have it—I have it!” he cried.</p>
<p class="pnext">“It occurs to me,” said Uncle John, a little
resentfully, “that you deserve all you’ve got, and
more. It’s a wonder you didn’t break your
neck.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What have you, Run?” asked Arthur.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’ve found the laces.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“What?—where?” they exclaimed.</p>
<p class="pnext">“In the blue room, or on the way down?”
added Beth sarcastically.</p>
<p class="pnext">“After I got down,” he answered. “What
fools we have all been!”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Will you kindly explain, Mr. Runyon?”
asked Mildred, very earnestly.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I will. It’s simple enough. Just look at that
bed.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“The bed!” And now every eye was turned
upon the couch.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Of course,” said Runyon. “There’s something
more than a mere mattress and springs.
I’ve tumbled onto the thing twice, and I ought to
know.”</p>
</div>
<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-xxia-fortune-in-tatters">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id22">CHAPTER XXI—A FORTUNE IN TATTERS</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">Already Arthur was pulling off the bedding
and piling it upon the floor. They stood back of
him in an excited group, every head craned forward
to watch his movements.</p>
<p class="pnext">Off came the pillows—blankets—sheets—finally
the mattress. This last, a thin cotton affair,
left a trail of fuzzy, lint-like debris behind it
and disclosed on removal a canvas cover that had
been spread underneath. The canvas, which was
about on a level with the boxed-in bed frame,
was as full of holes as a Swiss cheese and especially
toward the center the weave had become
disintegrated and given away to a dusty pulp.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Rats!” exclaimed Uncle John, whose head
was thrust between the shoulders of the major
and Runyon.</p>
<p class="pnext">As if his cry had been a summons, out sprang
a huge gray rodent and the girls pushed back
with loud screams as the dreaded beast struck the
floor and scurried away down the passage. Another
and another followed it, and now Louise,
Patsy, Beth, Mildred and Inez were all dancing
on top the seats, wrapping their skirts about their
ankles and whooping like a tribe of Indians.</p>
<p class="pnext">Amid this wild hullabaloo, which struck terror
to the hearts of the brave men assembled, because
at the instant they were too bewildered to realize
what caused it, some six or eight monstrous rats
leaped from the tattered canvas which covered
the bed and vanished down the stairs.</p>
<p class="pnext">Arthur put his hand down to raise the canvas
and jumped back as he unearthed a nest of
smaller vermin, squirming here and there in blind
endeavors to escape their disturbers. Runyon
brought a deep brass bowl from a shelf and
dumped the small rats into it, standing by to capture
others as they appeared.</p>
<p class="pnext">Gradually Weldon drew back the cover and
as he did so the truth of Runyon’s prophecy was
apparent. The entire space boxed in by the
carved bed-frame, from the floor to its upper
edge, was packed solidly with valuable laces.
That is, it had once been solidly packed, but now
the rats had eaten tunnels and nests and boulevards
through the costly laces in every direction.
It was a scene of absolute ruin. However
precious this collection might once have been, in
its present state it was not worth a copper cent.</p>
<p class="pnext">The party gazed upon the sight with mingled
awe and astonishment. Regret for the destruction
of the beautiful fabrics at first rendered them
oblivious to the fact that the inheritance of Mildred
Leighton was at last recovered—only to
be proved worthless.</p>
<p class="pnext">Arthur dragged out a few scraps and spread
them upon the floor, thereby exhibiting portions
of the beautiful patterns of the various pieces.
Then, hoping to find some that had escaped the
ruthless teeth of the rats, he and Runyon began
pulling at the heap and working downward toward
the floor. Just a few small pieces were
found intact, but these were of slight value.
Practically the entire lot was irretrievably ruined.</p>
<p class="pnext">Scarcely a word was spoken as the investigation proceeded.
Beth had clasped one of Mildred’s
hands and Patsy the other, but neither
dared look in the poor girl’s face, for they
dreaded the poignant disappointment sure to
reign there.</p>
<p class="pnext">But after the first shock, Mildred bore up
bravely. She had not expected, in the beginning,
any tangible result; still it was very bitter to find
her long sought fortune and realize that it
amounted to nothing.</p>
<p class="pnext">They sat around upon the benches, or leaning
against the wall, and stared at the ruined laces
with various emotions, the keenest being regret
for the loss of so much beautiful handwork and
sympathy for Mildred Leighton.</p>
<p class="pnext">Suddenly Runyon broke the silence.</p>
<p class="pnext">“This discovery is too thundering bad for
mere words,” he said with feeling; “but Miss
Travers—Mildred—must know we’re all as
sorry as she is. She was right about the laces,
but the laces are all wrong. This sad exhibit reminds
me of my own perverse mortgages, and my
mortgages remind me of something else. Mildred,”
he added, turning to the girl in a dogged
and rather shamefaced way, “I’m going to hold
a private conversation with you right here before
our good friends, for I know every one of them
will back me up. Eh?” he questioned, glancing
around the group.</p>
<p class="pnext">There were some smiles, but many nods. As if
encouraged, Runyon proceeded:</p>
<p class="pnext">“This settles the question of your fortune.
It’s gone—vanished into scraps. You’re a poor
girl, now, with no glittering prospects, so what
I’m going to say won’t seem quite so selfish as it
would otherwise. In fact, had these laces been
perfect, they would have rendered me dumb. As
it is, here stand two impecunious ones—you and
I. Between us we haven’t much more than
enough to fry a fish, in solid cash, but among my
encumbrances are a delightful little bungalow,
nicely furnished, and a lot of lemon trees that
can be coaxed to buy us groceries and ordinary
comforts. I’m a lonely fellow, Mildred, and I
need a companion. Will you marry me, and look
after that bungalow?”</p>
<p class="pnext">This extraordinary proposal was heard in
breathless silence. The men were astounded, the
girls delighted. Every eye turned curiously upon
Mildred Travers, who regarded the big rancher
with frank wonder, a wan smile upon her pallid
features.</p>
<p class="pnext">“You do not say you love me,” she suggested,
striving through mild banter to cover her confusion.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well, isn’t that implied?” he answered.
“No one would propose to a girl he didn’t love,
would he?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“You have only known me two days.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Two days and seven hours. But mother endorsed
you and I’ll bank on her judgment.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“When the mortgages come due, there won’t
be any bungalow,” she continued.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Don’t you believe it,” cried Runyon, earnestly.
“With you to work for, I’ll make those
tart old lemons pay the interest and a good income
besides. In fact, if we live long enough, we
may even manage to reduce the mortgages. You
see, I’ve been extravagant and foolish, but it was
because I had no aim in life. The minute you say
‘yes,’ I’m a reformed character.”</p>
<p class="pnext">She shook her head and the smile faded from
her face.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Don’t think me ungrateful, Mr. Runyon,”
she said quietly. “Unusual and—and—peculiar—as
this proposal is, I believe you are sincere
in what you say. But you are influenced
just now by pity for me and I assure you I am
quite capable of earning my own living.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But—oh, Mildred—-he’s so lonely,” cried
Patsy, impulsively.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I’m sorry for that,” she said, “but it is not
my fault.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“It will be, though, if you refuse,” declared
Runyon.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I fear I must.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I see,” he said with a sigh. “Mother endorsed
you, but she didn’t endorse me. You’ve
heard some tough yarns about me—all true as
gospel—and you’re prejudiced. I don’t know
as I blame you. If I were a girl I’d hesitate to
reform such a desperate character, I’m sure. But
I’ve the notion there’s the making of a decent
fellow in me, if the right workman undertakes
the job.”</p>
<p class="pnext">She looked at him earnestly, now—very earnestly.
In spite of the squeaky voice and the
inopportune time he had chosen for such a
serious proposal, there was an innate manliness
and ingenuousness in his attitude, as he stood
there unabashed and towering above the other
men, that seemed to her admirable and impressive.
Both Beth and Patsy were reflecting that a
girl might do much worse than to accept Bulwer
Runyon as a mate.</p>
<p class="pnext">Said Mildred, still speaking in the same quiet
and composed voice:</p>
<p class="pnext">“I will give you a positive answer in three
days, Mr. Runyon. That delay is mere justice to
us both.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Thank you,” he said. “Shall we fuss with
these tattered laces any longer? It hardly seems
worth while.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Now that the strain of the situation was removed
they all began chattering volubly in order
to give countenance to Mildred. Runyon seemed
not to need such consideration.</p>
<p class="pnext">Old Miguel had witnessed and overheard this
scene from the background and his bright black
eyes had roamed restlessly from the girl’s face to
Runyon’s as if trying to read their true feelings.
The discovery of the laces had not drawn any
exclamation from the ancient ranchero, whose
stolid expression nothing seemed able to disturb.
As the others filed down the stairs and out of the
recess in the wall, into the roomy nursery, old
Miguel followed imperturbable and serene as
ever. In the court he touched his hat to his master.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I go now, Meest Weld?” he asked.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes. Thank you, Miguel, for your help.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I thank you, too,” said Mildred, stepping forward
to take the Mexican’s hand. “I remember
you well, Miguel. In the old days you often took
care of me while my father and Señor Cristoval
talked. Don’t you remember?”</p>
<p class="pnext">He nodded, his eyes fixed full upon her face.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Once a friend, always a friend, Miguel,” she
continued brightly. “Even to-day you have been
trying to help me, and I am grateful. Some time
we will have a good talk together about the old
days.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Then he went away, and if one who knew old
Miguel Zaloa could have followed him, his actions
would have caused surprise.</p>
<p class="pnext">First he wandered deep into the orange groves,
where—when absolutely alone—he began muttering
excitedly. At times he would kick his
booted foot viciously against a tree-trunk, regardless
of the impact that numbed his toes and
sent a tingle up his legs. After a time this remarkable
exhibit of passion subsided and for the
period of half an hour he stood quite motionless,
staring straight before him and seeing nothing.
Then he started off through the groves, climbed
the fence into the lane and marched away
through miles and miles of the surrounding country.</p>
<p class="pnext">It was growing dark when Miguel at last appeared
at the quarters, growling at the men and
ordering them to get into the groves and work.
They marked his ill temper and took care not to
arouse his further anger. In the morning he
was up at daybreak and in more gentle mood directed
the beginning of the day’s labors.</p>
</div>
<div class="level-2 section" id="chapter-xxiifaithful-and-true">
<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><a class="toc-backref pginternal" href="#id23">CHAPTER XXII—FAITHFUL AND TRUE</a></h2>
<p class="pfirst">Late that afternoon Arthur and Louise sat in
the court, chatting with their guests, who were
occupied in coddling and amusing baby Jane,
when Inez approached Mr. Weldon and said
that Miguel wished to speak with him.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Send him here,” said Arthur, and presently
the old Mexican appeared, again arrayed in his
best clothes and with the red necktie carefully
arranged. He held his hat in his hand and looked
uncertainly around the circle. Then his eyes
wandered to the nursery and through the open
door he saw Mildred sitting in a rocker, engaged
in reading a book. Runyon had gone home that
morning, “to see if the ranch is still there,” he
said.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I have—some—private talks to make,
Meest Weld,” began the old ranchero.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Speak out, Miguel,” said his master encouragingly.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Oh; but he said ‘private,’” Patsy reminded
him.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I know. Miguel understands that he may
speak before my friends.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“It ees—about—Señor Cristoval, Meest
Weld.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes? Well, what about him, Miguel?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I am once servant for Señor Cristoval. I
stay here in house with him, long time. When he
get sick, before he die, I care for him. Doctor
say to me that Señor Cristoval can not get well;
I say so to Señor Cristoval. He say never mind,
he have live long enough.”</p>
<p class="pnext">This was interesting to them all in view of the
recent happenings, and the girls bent nearer to
hear the old man’s story. Arthur, the major and
Uncle John were equally intent.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Señor Cristoval, he say, when he get very
bad, there ees one thing he hate to leave, an’ that
ees—his money,” continued Miguel. “He say,
money ees his bes’ friend, all time. But he no
can take money where he will go. He ees mad
that many poor fools will spend the money he
have love an’ cared for. So he make me take
three big bag of gold an’ drive to bank an’ put
away so the poor fools will find it. Much more
money ees in bank, too. Then, when doctor
come, he ask me when he will die, an’ doctor say
when sun next shine Señor Cristoval will not
see it. Doctor want to stay all night, but Señor
Cristoval pay an’ tell him go. He want to die
alone.</p>
<p class="pnext">“But I am there. Some time in night Señor
Cristoval he call an’ say: ‘Miguel, I mus’ not die
till I have give to Leighton what belong to him.
I have keep Leighton’s money for him. I will
show you where it ees hid, so you can give it to
Leighton.’”</p>
<p class="pnext">Ah, they were intent enough now. Intuitively
each listener seemed to know that a secret was
about to be revealed and many glances were cast
toward the unconscious Mildred, who continued
to read placidly. But no one interrupted the old
Mexican.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I help Senor Cristoval to stand up. He ees
not strong, so I hold him. He walk from blue
room to back room an’ there he show me how to
take block from wall. Behind block ees big place
for money. Señor Cristoval he say all money
what belong to Leighton ees there. He tell me
count it. So I put Señor Cristoval in chair an’ he
watch while I take out money an’ count. There
ees four bag. I count three bag an’ he say good,
it ees right. He say count last bag. So I empty
bag on floor an’ count gold an’ put in bag again.
When thees ees done I say: ‘Is eet right?’ But
Señor Cristoval say nothing. I look up, an’
Señor Cristoval ees dead.”</p>
<p class="pnext">The old man spoke simply and quietly, but
they found his relation intensely dramatic.
Patsy was trembling with excitement. Beth
clasped Louise’s hand and found it cold from
nervousness.</p>
<p class="pnext">“And then, Miguel?” said Arthur.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Then, Meest Weld, I put gold in wall an’
fix block so no one know an’ carry Señor Cristoval
to his bed. That ees all, Meest Weld.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“And you told no one of Leighton’s gold?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I tell no one. It ees belong to Leighton.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Where is it now, Miguel?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“In wall, Meest Weld.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“All of it?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“All.”</p>
<p class="pnext">There was a moment’s pause.</p>
<p class="pnext">“You know now that it belongs to Mildred—to
Leighton’s daughter,—do you not?” he
asked, an accent of sternness in his voice.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I know, Meest Weld.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Then why did you not tell us of this before?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Old Miguel stood silent, shifting from one foot
to another, his eyes cast down, his slender brown
fingers spasmodically pressing the rim of his
sombrero. But when he spoke it was in his former
quiet manner.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I am a bad man, Meest Weld. I theenk I
keep gold for myself. Why not, when no one
know? Long time after Señor Cristoval die no
one come here. Some time I go to room an’
count gold. When I see it I have bad thought.
I theenk it ees nice if I keep all myself. But
when I go away an’ work in the grove, I tell
Miguel many time that gold ees not his; it ees
Leighton’s gold. I say when Leighton come for
it he mus’ have it. But Leighton do not come.
Many year the gold ees mine, an’ no one know.
Then come Leighton’s girl, an’ I know I am bad
man if I keep gold. But I say nothing. I theenk
no one ever know.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But tell me,” said Arthur curiously, “what
good is the money to you when it is hidden in a
wall?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Not much, Meest Weld; but I know I am
rich. I say I can buy ranch an’ be big man, an’
no one know I have steal Leighton’s gold.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Then why have you told us the secret?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Miguel glanced toward the nursery.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I am man for work,” said he. “Always I
work; always I mus’ work. I am old. When I
can no work, I mus’ die. Señor Cristoval mus’
leave gold when he die; it ees same with Miguel.
Now I have good job. I can work an’ be happy.
But—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Well, Miguel?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Leighton’s daughter, she ees a girl. A girl
can not work like a man. It ees her gold, not
mine. When you say it, I will show you where
Leighton’s gold ees hid.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Uncle John sprang up and grasped the man’s
hand.</p>
<p class="pnext">“You are an honest fellow, Miguel!” he
cried.</p>
<p class="pnext">“No, Meest Mereek,” was the reply. “I have
wish to steal, so I am not honest.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“But you have given up the gold.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes, Meest Mereek; because I am afraid.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“I don’t believe a word of it,” said Patsy.
“You were tempted to do wrong, Miguel, and
if you had kept silent no one would ever have
known; but you told us of the gold, and so you
are faithful and true.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Ah, that ees what Meest Leighton tell me,
some time,” said he. “An’ that ees what spoil
me from being bad. Because Leighton say I am
faithful an’ true, I have theenk I mus’ be that
way. That ees it.”</p>
<hr class="docutils"/>
<p class="pfirst">Mildred’s gold proved to be a small fortune.
Perhaps Cristoval had added to his partner’s
earnings, for the child’s sake, for the total
amounted to more than she had ever expected.</p>
<p class="pnext">It was all in hard cash and Arthur drove over
to the bank and deposited it to the credit of Mildred
Travers, as she preferred to retain that
name.</p>
<p class="pnext">Patsy and Beth were curious to know what the
girl would do with her windfall, but Mildred
proved noncommittal.</p>
<p class="pnext">“How about Bul Run?” asked Patsy.</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred smiled but blushed deeply at the question.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Would my money be enough to pay his mortgages?”
she inquired.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Perhaps,” said Beth, “but that would be
foolish. He would soon be in debt again.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“No, no!” protested Patsy. “I’m sure he
will reform if—”</p>
<p class="pnext">“If Mildred marries him?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred seemed troubled.</p>
<p class="pnext">“The best way,” declared Beth, “would be
to have Mildred keep her money in her own
name, and help out in case of emergency.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred approved that, and being pressed by
the two girls she frankly confided to them that
she would accept Mr. Runyon when he came for
his answer.</p>
<p class="pnext">Runyon appeared on the third day and Arthur
met him and told him the good news of the finding
of Mildred’s inheritance. But the effect of
this discovery on the big rancher was to overwhelm
him with despair.</p>
<p class="pnext">“She will never marry me now,” he asserted
in doleful tones, “and I’d rather die than ask
her. It would be beastly to take such an advantage
of the poor child. When she was poor, I
could offer her a home with good grace, but now
that she’s rolling in gold the jig is up! If you’ll
tell me, where I can find old Miguel, I’ll strangle
the villain. Why in thunder couldn’t he hold his
tongue?”</p>
<p class="pnext">Arthur laughingly replied that money
wouldn’t make a particle of difference with a girl
like Mildred, but Runyon would not listen and
remained disconsolate. He stayed at the ranch,
but moped around with a woe-begone countenance
and refused to speak with anyone.</p>
<p class="pnext">Patsy and Beth skillfully contrived several opportunities
for Runyon to approach Mildred, but
he ignored all chances and preferred to remain
miserable. The day passed without his demanding
his answer. Mildred had been bright and
expectant and the girls read her disappointment
when her unaccountable wooer delayed putting
his fortune to the test.</p>
<p class="pnext">The next day he was no more cheerful, but
rather seemed to have accumulated an added
gloom. He sought a garden bench and smoked
innumerable cigars in solitary grief. If anyone
approached, Runyon would retreat to the shrubbery.
At mealtime he was likewise silent but
consumed enormous quantities of food, which
made Patsy accuse him of being an impostor.</p>
<p class="pnext">“No regulation lover,” she said to him, “ever
had an appetite. The novels all say so. Therefore
you can’t love Mildred a bit.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Runyon groaned, cast her a reproachful glance
and went on eating.</p>
<p class="pnext">Several days passed without his asking Mildred
for her answer, and now the absurd situation
began to get on all their nerves. Mildred
herself grew impatient and watched from the
nursery window the garden bench on which Runyon
sat gloomily in his perpetual cloud of smoke.</p>
<p class="pnext">“He’ll make himself sick, with those black
cigars, I’m sure,” observed Patsy, on one occasion.</p>
<p class="pnext">“And he can’t afford to smoke so many,”
added Beth. “Unless this thing stops, he’ll soon
have to take out a new mortgage.”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Or sell some lemons,” added Patsy.</p>
<p class="pnext">“I believe,” said Mildred slowly, as if summoning
her courage, “I will speak to him myself.
Don’t you think that would be best?”</p>
<p class="pnext">“Of course,” approved Patsy. “Runyon is a
big baby, and needs a nurse more than little Jane.
I’ll hold Toodlums, Mildred, while you sally
forth and take the bull by the horns.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred looked at Beth for counsel.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Unless you speak to him,” said that young
lady, “you will never get together. Moreover,
the rest of us will grow mad or idiotic. So, for
all our sakes, you’d better take Mr. Runyon in
hand. You’ll have to manage him afterward,
anyhow, so the sooner you begin the better.”</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred handed little Jane to Patsy and left
the nursery. Through the window the other girls
watched her approach Mr. Runyon and stand before
him. At once he stood up and threw away
his cigar, but his face was toward them and they
could see that he did not speak.</p>
<p class="pnext">Mildred, however, was talking very earnestly.
Runyon shook his head. He turned half away.
Then he swung sharply around and caught the
girl in his arms.</p>
<p class="pnext">“Come, Beth,” said Patsy; “let’s go and tell
Louise.”</p>
